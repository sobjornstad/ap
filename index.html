        <em>Commodification of attention</em> is a system of organizational,

especially social ones, I think COA is partially responsible for, including the
degradation of quality in web searches, many of the negative effects of social

    <p>This afternoon I was trying to watch TV with a friend, and whenever she tried
to select something on Netflix to watch, the Roku app crashed and we had to
start over again. After several repetitions, she handed the remote to me,
suggesting that the TV ‚Äúdidn't like her‚Äù and maybe I would have better luck. I
didn't, but I realized later that at the time, I think I actually legitimately
thought this sounded like a reasonable troubleshooting step!</p>

<p>As dumb as that sounds, we ended up ‚Äúsolving‚Äù the problem by going to Target
(which we wanted to do anyway) and coming back, then trying again. This time it
worked on the first try. It seems to me that this approach has an only
marginally larger space of reasonable causal explanations, and yet this one
worked.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what the lesson here is, except that software is terrible and I
have no idea how anything ever works at all.</p>

    <div class="post-description">In which the MPD does their job and I clean up blueberries left by a heroin addict</div>
    <p>Last Saturday, I was busy at home all day, and when I stepped out to take out
my trash and go for a walk at around 4:00 in the afternoon, I noticed that my
car wasn't in its spot. That's pretty strange, I thought, where would I have
left it? It wasn't until I thought for a few more moments that I realized it
couldn't possibly have been me being an idiot and forgetting where I parked, as
it normally is; I'd gotten home after midnight and gone right into my apartment
and not left it since, and there was no conceivable reason I would have parked
anywhere than in my assigned spot. I hadn't been drinking or anything, and I
knew I'd driven home.</p>

<p>My upstairs neighbor still had a key from when I was in San Francisco earlier
this year (so she could move my car out of the way of the plows as needed), so
I texted her to ask if she'd moved it for some reason, but she definitely
hadn't. And there was no reason I would have been towed, and no tracks in the
fresh snow from a tow truck. Which seemingly left only the possibility it had
been stolen. This was all but confirmed when I noticed that two of my car's
floor mats had been left on the ground; obviously a tow driver wouldn't have
broken into my car and thrown out the floor mats before taking it!</p>

<p>After a frustrating 20 minutes of trying to find a non-emergency number that
was open over the weekend, I went ahead and called 911 and reported it stolen.
They took the details over the phone and someone from the police department
came out basically promptly (they were a few minutes later than expected, but
who isn't?) and was very nice and helpful.</p>

<p>Not only that, but they actually found my car Monday morning and brought it
into the impound lot. Granted, they didn't have a very hard time; whoever stole
it had abandoned it in the middle of the lane during rush hour at 50th and
Xerxes (a major intersection in SW Minneapolis).</p>

<p>On Thursday I spent a couple of hours cleaning out all the junk they left in
the car, which included, along with a bunch of trash and random items,
somewhere around eight used needles (they helpfully provided a portable sharps
container in the back seat, although it would have been rather more helpful had
they actually put the sharps <em>in</em> the sharps container; I guess that
would have made too much sense). There were also a bunch of spilled blueberries
on the floor, which doesn't exactly strike me as common junkie food! The car is
still at the body shop getting an inspection, a new bumper, and a thorough
cleaning, but it got away without much damage for a stolen car and I'll
hopefully have it back in a few days.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, they didn't actually steal anything that was inside the car
except for my dashcam (unsurprisingly; you'd have to be pretty dumb to leave a
live dashcam in a stolen car), the spare key I'd left inside the car by mistake
(obviously how they stole it; I must have inadvertently left the door unlocked
as well, on the day that this person decided to wander to the back of my
apartment building and try the doors on the parked cars, setting up a perfect
storm), and, bizarrely, my car's proof of registration and insurance. They
didn't even take the cash I'd left inside.</p>

<p>Anyway, my faith that the Minneapolis Police Department isn't completely
useless was slightly restored! Of course, it probably helps that I'm white‚Ä¶</p>

    <div class="post-description">Revenge of the 20th-century streetcar tracks</div>
    <p>In <a href="#post-47">#47</a>, in discussing Lowry Hill Park, I mentioned in
passing that Minneapolis used to have an extensive streetcar system that was
paved over in the mid-20th century.</p>

<p>This winter has turned our roads into a mess of potholes, probably due to an
unusual number of freeze-thaw cycles (to give you an idea of how bad it is, a
friend told me they saw a driver in front of them run over a pothole on the
I-94 onramp at Hennepin Avenue that gave such a big jolt that <em>the airbags
deployed</em>). In a discussion about the roads on the Minneapolis subreddit,
someone noted that damage at the intersection of Lake Street and Hennepin
Avenue had actually exposed the old tracks and brick roadbed that had been
paved over, so I took a little detour over there when I walked down to the bank
today, and sure enough:</p>

<p>Closeup taken from the other side while crossing (the brick is remarkably
well-preserved; I guess being sealed in by asphalt will do that):</p>

    <div class="post-description">In which ChatGPT does chord analysis not even wrong</div>
    <p>A bluesy song I'm learning includes the following progression in the key of D
major:</p>

<blockquote>
D ‚Äì F#7 ‚Äì G ‚Äì D ‚Äì A ‚Äì D
</blockquote>

<p>(Actually, I added the seventh because it sounded better with the mandolin's
sometimes-awkward voicing; it was a bare F# major in my source.)</p>

<p>I wasn't, and am still not, sure how to describe the function of the F#
dominant seventh. When you play it, you can hear that it plainly leads into the
G, which makes some sense to me given that it's built on the seventh scale
degree of G and thus acts sort of like a V7/V (D7) would, but I can't quite put
a name on it. (I initially suspected <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritone_substitution">tritone
substitution</a>, but the relationship is off by a whole step.) In a major key,
it doesn't make sense to talk about the seventh scale degree being major, so it
must be getting borrowed from some other scale or have some funky name or
principle all its own. Please enlighten me if you know!</p>

<p>Anyhow, as part of my search, I decided to see how ChatGPT would do at chord
analysis. Here's what I got:</p>

<img loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/chord-analysis-1.png" alt="ChatGPT's first response">

<p>This actually wasn't a horribly bad first attempt; my initial prediction
before looking at the notes was also that the chord was a V/V or something
similar. But when I pointed out that this couldn't be correct because the V in
D major is A, and F# is separated from A by a major sixth, it produced this
delightfully confident nonsense:</p>

    <p>For my whole life, I have strongly disliked iced tea.
This wouldn't be particularly weird, except that I love hot tea
    and drink probably 4‚Äì6 cups on a typical day.
Iced tea, even high-quality brewed iced tea,
    tastes gross and bitter and sometimes even makes me gag.</p>

<p>I think there might be something funny going on here
    where most people's perception of tea strength
    scales differently based on temperature than mine.
Ordinarily people brew iced tea around twice as strong as hot tea
    because tastes are perceived more weakly when food is cold.
Maybe I should try some iced-tea brewing experiments
    at different intermediate strengths
    and see if it ever starts tasting good?</p>

<p>Possibly related: I dislike hot drinks that contain alcohol
    even though I like most cold or room-temperature alcoholic beverages,
    including strong spirits ‚Äì
    the alcohol taste feels quite overpowering in hot drinks.
I'm not sure how this fits into that picture, though,
    since the iced tea/hot tea divide would suggest
    that I notice temperature-based strength differences
    <em>less</em> than the average person,
    while this would seemingly suggest <em>more</em>.</p>

    <div class="post-description">Stupid cold hand dryers</div>
    <p>Ever wonder why hand dryers take such a long time to warm up? Turns
out‚Ä¶<em>they don't</em>, as xkcd <a href="https://xkcd.com/2743/">pointed
out</a> this week. Hand dryers work by encouraging the water to evaporate from
your hands. When water evaporates off something, it cools rapidly ‚Äì think about
what happens when you climb out of a bath or pool. (This is also how both
sweating and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporative_cooler">swamp
coolers</a> dissipate heat.) In the case of hand dryers, this cooling effect is
strong enough to make the jet feel cold even though it's actually quite hot ‚Äì
until your hands are nearly dry, just in time to make you grumble about how it
only managed to get nice and hot when you were already done drying your hands.</p>

<p>I still didn't quite believe this, but you can try this one at home! Grab a
hair dryer, set it down sideways on a flat surface with something behind it to
prevent it from jet-propelling itself across the table (or, better yet, enlist
a fellow householder to hold it, then switch places and enlighten them with
this demo), and get just one of your hands wet. Then switch it on at the
highest and hottest setting. Sure enough, mine reaches full power ‚Äì hot enough
to be painful on a closely placed dry hand ‚Äì within 5 seconds after a cold
start, yet still feels cold on the wet hand.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, I've been low-grade puzzled for years about why my hair
dryer only <em>sometimes</em> seems to take forever to heat up. Once you know
all this, of course, the answer is as blatantly obvious as it was mysterious
before: sometimes my hair is wetter when I start drying it, which makes it feel
colder for longer.</p>

<p>I'm sure some of y'all think this is obvious and are laughing at the rest of
us now, to which I can only say, this xkcd appears to be autobiographical, and
if Randall Monroe, a former NASA engineer and author of bestselling silly
physics books, only recently figured this out, it can't be <em>that</em>
obvious, can it?</p>

    <div class="post-description">Metaphor Systems</div>
    <p><a href="https://metaphor.systems">Metaphor</a> is an experimental new kind of
search engine based on an LLM. Rather than typing in keywords describing what
you're looking for, you pretend you already have the link you want and are
sending it to a friend, and write a brief introduction explaining what it is.
Then it supplies a list of predictions for what link you might be talking about.</p>

<p>This works surprisingly well. I find it especially useful if I am thinking of an
article I know exists somewhere on the web, but can't remember what it was
called; it's challenging to find effective keywords for a traditional search
engine in this case, but usually easy to describe the article in enough detail
that Metaphor can find it.</p>

<p>Metaphor is currently free and open to the public.
Give it a try:

    <div class="post-description">What the heck is TiddlyWiki, actually?</div>
    <p>The other day I was on a first date
    and we were talking about our experiences of the early COVID-19 pandemic,
    and I mentioned that I had used much of my excessive free time to write
    a textbook called <a href="https://groktiddlywiki.com">Grok TiddlyWiki</a>.
Naturally, she asked what TiddlyWiki was,
    and I realized, somewhat to my alarm, that I had no effective way to explain it.
If anyone in the entire world
    should be able to give a good elevator pitch for TiddlyWiki,
    surely it ought to be me,
    seeing as I recently spent a year and a half writing a book to teach people how to use it!
My first reach was ‚Äú<a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a>, but more customizable,‚Äù
    but she hadn't heard of Notion,
    so that didn't help at all,
    and this seems like a cop-out anyway;
    it just moves the question to, what the heck is Notion, actually?</p>

<p>Once you get over the immediate absurdity of the fact that
    I just wrote a book about this tool and I still can't concisely explain what it is,
    that this is challenging isn't actually all that surprising:
    a general problem with researching, developing, and promoting
    tools for thought like TiddlyWiki
    is that they
    <a href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#ToolsForThinkingDontWow">don't wow</a>.
That is, because the really revolutionary ones allow you to think in new ways,
    the problem of understanding why the tool is useful
    and the problem of learning the tool
    are necessarily intertwined;
    without the habits of thought developed by learning and using the tool,
    the tool in some way <em>can't</em> make sense.
(Paul Graham popularized this line of thought back in 2001
 when he wrote about <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">Blub programmers</a>.)</p>

<p>This said, surely I can at least do better than ‚ÄúNotion, but more customizable.‚Äù
A good start is the front page of <em>Grok</em> itself:</p>

<blockquote>
TiddlyWiki is a human-shaped tool for organizing information and taking notes. It stores and relates information in a non-linear but structured way, just like your brain, and it doesn't forget things.
</blockquote>

<p>It's helpful to add some use cases, like I do a bit lower down:</p>

<blockquote>
People use TiddlyWiki for keeping notes at their jobs, collecting their ideas, keeping track of what they read, drafting books, building static websites, storing recipes, managing genealogical databases, planning tabletop role-playing campaigns, and much more.
</blockquote>

<p>The big problem here is that, reading this description,
    you still don't know anything
    about <em>how</em> one uses TiddlyWiki to do this.
This is not really a problem for <em>Grok TiddlyWiki</em>,
    since the entire rest of the book is about this,
    but it's a big problem if you're trying to educate and/or hook
    people who aren't already interested.
It's like we've explained what a car is
    but not talked about how one uses the steering wheel
    and pedals to make it move around.
If you've never heard of a car or seen someone drive one,
    it's going to be tough to imagine someone using one without those details,
    and I find it's difficult to understand the value or purpose of software
    if you can't imagine the experience of using it.</p>

<p>Here's my best shot at a version that incorporates most of the ideas above.
It starts by comparing to a tool almost everyone will know,
    but doesn't rely on that comparison;
    it incorporates the ‚Äúhuman-shaped‚Äù idea
    and the example use cases,
    and it tries to give a picture of the actions one takes
    when working with a TiddlyWiki.
Its biggest weakness is that it tends on the formal and dense side.
I feel like I should be spending many more days on this problem;
    it's hard to imagine how the field of tools for thought in general
    is going to succeed unless we find a way to explain why it's important!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>TiddlyWiki</strong> is a tool that helps you think in new ways
    by extending the fundamental ideas of the spreadsheet
    so that they work effectively with long-form prose.
Information in TiddlyWiki has a flexible structure,
    so you can match the shape of your content within the wiki
    to the way you think about it.
Things can be organized strictly,
    in tables like a spreadsheet
        or in hierarchies like an outline,
    or loosely, in webs of related components with nebulous relationships,
    and you can show the same data in different formats at different times.
You split your facts and ideas into little pieces called <em>tiddlers</em>
    (much like rows of a spreadsheet)
    and the tiddlers into fields (much like columns),
    then add links and tags to describe the relationships between tiddlers.
Then you can use custom formulas and formatting options
    to search, filter, sort,
        answer questions about the relationships between things,
        and change the appearance of your wiki to look like almost anything at all.</p>

<p>The amount of flexibility TiddlyWiki affords makes it challenging to learn or even explain
    ‚Äì you have to develop a few new ways of thinking to make effective use of the tool ‚Äì
    so that's what my book is designed to help with.
I use my primary TiddlyWiki as a sort of topically organized journal,
    keeping track of things I've learned about myself, my life, and the world
    in a form where I can easily build on previous insights.</p>

    <p>I tried to go for a walk on the beach today. I did not think to check the wind
speed, which turned out to be 30mph gusting to 55mph. The Pacific was looking
pretty majestic, but I basically got low-pressure sandblasted as I walked
along. I also planned to take a shortcut through what looked on Google Maps
like a public park but turned out to be a heavily fenced private golf course,
and ended up having to walk along the median of a four-lane highway and then
vault over a jersey barrier to get to the beach (there wasn't too much traffic
and it felt pretty safe, but it wasn't exactly pleasant!).</p>

<p>You know it's windy when your <s>windsock</s>ponytail sits at the side of your

    <div class="post-description">The Harrow and the Harvest</div>
    <p>Now in San Francisco for the month, this weekend I rented a car and did a road
trip north on Highway 1 to Fort Bragg, a beautiful drive. I brought with me and
listened to (multiple times) all the albums of Gillian Welch, who I recently
rediscovered. As funny as it sounds to say this since this was only five years
ago, I think I wasn't old enough to appreciate it when I heard it for the first
time, just after graduating college.</p>

<p>(Although most of the music they make together is under the name ‚ÄúGillian
Welch‚Äù, Welch's partner David Rawlings is as essential a part of it as she is;
they write the songs together and he plays lead guitar and sings harmony on
everything.)</p>

<p>What I love about Welch and Rawlings &ndash; and the reason I think I wasn't
old enough to get it before &ndash; is that they tell the story of life just
like it is. They neither sugarcoat things nor tell unmitigated tragedies; their
songs are almost universally about suffering and loss and struggle, often
severe, and yet somewhere there's always a tinge of solace and redemption,
often so subtle and implied that you can't figure out where it comes from, but
you feel it, a testament to the fact that despite all this, people manage to
make life not just tolerable but very worth living. There are certainly no
promises, but there is hope.</p>

<p>In recent years their arrangements have been sparse, usually just their voices
and two guitars, occasionally a little mandolin or banjo or percussion; it
sounds like two people sitting on their porch picking, except they're insanely
good. Musicians will know these simple arrangements are not the easiest but the
hardest to get right, because there's nowhere to hide the mistakes. But the two
of them are so perfectly in sync that there aren't any mistakes to hide. Their
voices even blend so well that sometimes I don't immediately notice Rawlings
has come in, even though he's singing different notes!</p>

<p>I think their finest work so far is <em><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37u3_659fXk&list=PLnfP0ZfzDtH94lj2KojYlEe5mAKk6qCNo">The
Harrow and the Harvest</a></em>, published in 2011. The epitome of everything
I've said above is the track <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k35haKwqY14&list=PLnfP0ZfzDtH94lj2KojYlEe5mAKk6qCNo&index=6">‚ÄúHard
Times‚Äù</a>, which borrows the title from Stephen Foster but takes the sentiment
in a totally different direction. Instead of being comfortable and sparing a
thought for those worse off than them, the characters are in the thick of it,
dealing with the hard times, and they don't presume to ask for hard times to
‚Äúcome again no more,‚Äù but simply promise themselves that the hard times ‚Äúwon't rule
their minds no more.‚Äù Yet the ploughman, very relatably, fails to take his own
advice, falling victim to modernization and ceasing his refrain, even as the
audience is exhorted to celebrate in the midst of it one more time.</p>

    <p>In <a href="#post-11">#11</a>, I was searching for terminology related to:</p>

    ...a pattern I've started noticing, in which someone wants to achieve a

<p>While I still don't have a clean word I like for it (but thanks to those who
have sent suggestions and interesting notes!), I noticed that David Cain has
the following enlightening diagram describing more or less this phenomenon in

    </div>
    <div>
        <p><em>Situation</em> (based on a true story): Three friends, Alice, Bob, and
Charlie, are planning on meeting up, but there is heavy snow. Alice writes to
say she can't make it because her street hasn't been plowed yet and her car
doesn't have enough clearance to drive through the snow. Bob and Charlie thus
learn the roads are probably going to be a real pain to venture out on, and
Alice can't make it, so they start to consider canceling, but aren't sure. Bob
thinks he would enjoy going if Charlie still actively wants to meet up, but
doesn't want to bother if they both feel this way.</p>

<p>Is there a concise way to describe Bob's attitude?</p>

        In this one, everyone actively believes they would prefer not to go,
        and agrees only because they (wrongly) believe others want to.
        In my example, Bob believes he would legitimately enjoy going
        as long as Charlie really wants to be there.

    <div class="post-description">The remarkable compounding of small amounts of time</div>
    <p>The average city dweller spends around four months of their life waiting at
red lights.</p>

<p>If this sounds impossible, here's the math: suppose you average about five
minutes a day waiting at various red lights. (That's probably eight average
lights' worth of waiting? I definitely wait at more some days, but then there
are days I don't go much of anywhere since I work from home, so this seems
about right. I'd expect it to be more for people who have significant commutes.
If you take the subway or grade-separated light rail most of the time, you get
to skip most of the red lights, but then you wait for your train to arrive
instead.) That makes 1,825 minutes per year. Then we'll say you spend 60 years
of your life in the city and traveling around regularly (this is probably an
underestimate), for 109,500 total minutes spent at red lights. Divide by 60
again for hours, and by 16 for waking hours per day, and you get 114 waking
days spent waiting, or just under four months.</p>

<p>Five minutes a day doesn't seem like much of a commitment. But actually it's a
<em>huge</em> one. You can get a lot done in five minutes a day if you're
<a href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#PowerOfKonsistency">consistent</a>.
You can also waste an enormous amount of time in five minutes a day if you're not
doing something worthwhile with it. (Exercise for the reader: can you do
something interesting while waiting at red lights?)</p>

<div class="callout">

    <em>Rule of thumb</em>: 15 minutes a day is 1/60 of your time. If you spend
    15 minutes daily for a year, you will have spent 6 days (or 12 full-time
    work days) total; for 60 years, 1 year total.

    <div class="post-description">Benefits of asymmetric social rules</div>
    <p>Even in a rather feminist-ideology-saturated 2022, it's quite rare for
straight women to ask out straight men. People of all genders seem to agree
this is silly, then shrug and keep doing exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>It struck me recently that there is at least one reason that
expecting one clearly defined person in any potential pairing to be in charge
of expressing interest could be functionally useful. Consider that it's quite
common for two people to actually be quite interested in becoming friends, but
for nobody to ever make a move because they're kind of shy and figure the other
person, presumably with better social skills, would do so if they were
interested. But when one person has reason to expect that the other will
<em>not</em> make the first move even if they're interested, there's much
stronger motivation for them to act. My suspicion is that significantly more
low-level-interest situations turn into dates under the current expectations
than would without them.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if that's worth it (especially because sometimes people don't
realize they're interested until another person expresses interest), but it's
certainly interesting. This is part of a constellation of struggles playing out
in today's world, between having social rules that are unnecessarily limiting
and/or don't work for some people, and having so few rules that people don't
know what to do. I expect to write more about this later.</p>

<p>After trying unsuccessfully to start it several times over a few days, I was
on the point of deciding it had crapped out on me and buying a new printer, but
was stubborn enough to try wading through some terrible troubleshooting advice
on the internet first. After several useless attempts, I found someone who
recommended unplugging the printer, removing the paper tray, and plugging it
back in. Astoundingly, this somehow worked ‚Äì the printer came on normally again
and works as well as always (which is ‚Äúnot that well,‚Äù since it's a
consumer-grade printer, but I'll take what I can get).</p>

<p>This reminds me of the time my monitor stopped working and I took it apart to
see if anything was obviously wrong. I couldn't find anything, so I put it back
together and on a whim plugged it in again. It worked again, and continued
working for another 5 years. There was one extra screw that I couldn't find a
place for, so I dubbed that the ‚Äúscrew of malfunctioning‚Äù and threw it away.</p>

    <p>Among the most confusing intersections I've ever seen:</p>

<img width="600" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/traffic-yield-confusion.jpg" alt="A yield sign combined with a stop sign because of railroad tracks">

<p>These train tracks in Southwest Minneapolis (Linden Hills, next to Lake
Harriet) are used only for <a href="https://trolleyride.org">a low-speed
tourist attraction</a>, so there are no crossing arms, and they put a YIELD
sign in front of them. So far so good. But then there's an intersection
<em>immediately</em> after it, with not even enough space to stop your car past
the tracks‚Ä¶and cross traffic has a STOP sign. But only on the right, not on the
left, because that street is one-way. Plus there's the post on the corner with
4¬†extra signs that draw away your attention and can block your view of the STOP
sign if you look over there while you're in your car.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn't <em>technically</em> wrong ‚Äì the YIELD sign is only
meant to apply to the train tracks, and then there is no sign controlling the
actual intersection, so you can go through and cross traffic has to stop for
you. But it's confusing as heck and they definitely should have picked a
different approach.</p>

<p>What happened to me, coming up to the intersection from the direction the
camera is looking: I yielded to (nonexistent) rail traffic, then started across
the tracks and was about to go through the intersection when I saw someone
coming from the right and went ‚ÄúWhoa, I had a YIELD sign!‚Äù and slammed on the
brakes, only to see they had a STOP sign. I had to walk back and look at the
intersection again after I parked to figure out what happened.</p>

    Someone needs to invent a hand gesture for driving that means ‚ÄúI know you
thought that was polite, but it was actually rude, cut it out.‚Äù There are times
when you can't really flip someone off or act affronted because they weren't
trying to be rude (so they would just conclude <em>you're</em> rude instead of
realizing they did something wrong), but if you wave or even do nothing,
they'll continue to think they're being nice.

The number-one use case would be when people yield even though they aren't
supposed to, creating unnecessary confusion, but now that I've had this idea, I
keep finding other moments I'd like to use it!

    <div class="post-description">New stuff: Church lock-in</div>
    <p>Today I helped supervise a bunch of high-schoolers at an overnight youth event
at my church, which I have not done before. This was equal parts chaos and fun
and consisted mostly of (1)¬†staying up until 2 AM and (2)¬†telling the kids not
to touch things that weren't theirs, break things, or disappear on us.</p>

<p>I felt about 15 years younger (in a good way) when I found myself and the
youth director (the only adults there) lying on the floor in sleeping bags in
the dark at 1:30 AM talking. The only difference was that we were talking about
getting older instead of high-school gossip!</p>

<div class="callout">

    <em>Gratuitous pedantic note on the newness of this experience</em>: I was
    technically a chaperone once before, at an event where anyone over 18 had
    to be registered as one and I was 18 years and 2 months. But this feels
    like claiming you've been to a country because you connected through an
    international airport there; <em>technically</em> you were on the ground
    within the country's borders, but realistically, for any reason you might
    care about whether you had been there, it makes no sense to count it. Very
    different experience this time.

    <div class="post-description">New stuff: Fort Snelling</div>
    <p>Today I went to the state park and historic site at Fort Snelling, located
next to the airport just southeast of Minneapolis, at the confluence of the
Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers.</p>

<img width="600" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/snelling-location.png" alt="The location of Fort Snelling">

<p>First I hiked a couple of miles. The trails were nice, many running next to
one of the rivers, and I'll definitely come back here; the only major drawback
is that it's pretty noisy, as it's right next to both the airport and several
major highways. Indeed, the historic area was almost demolished for Highway 5 ‚Äì
after public outcry, they ended up routing the highway through a tunnel
underneath it instead. (A substantial part of Fort Snelling was demolished for
the airport as well, but it was an area with very little historic value, made
up mostly of barracks for temporary residents who were going through training
or processing, some of them made of little more than tar paper on frames.)</p>

<img loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/snelling-tunnel.png" alt="The highway tunnel discussed above">

<p>Because it's midwinter, a lot of the historic site was closed, including the
main fort building, but the side museum was open, with a number of volunteers
doing little presentations. Normally I find people talking to me in museums
really annoying, because the exhibits are designed to be self-paced and then
you're forced to context-switch all the time between a carefully designed
exhibit and some random person who's telling you stuff. But these folks were
good and the exhibits were actually pretty boring without them, so I ended up
appreciating it (special shout-out to the woman who had just started yesterday
but was already able to talk in great detail for 20 minutes to me and two other
people about the complete chronology and function of the buildings on an
unlabeled birds-eye diorama of the fort).</p>

<p>I'll have to stop back up next summer to see the rest; they just redid the
whole place a couple of years ago and all of it is supposed to be really good.</p>

    <p>I missed yesterday because I was busy working and writing a bunch of stuff in
my Zettelkasten, but today I got back on the bandwagon with a visit to a little
tiny tea store which I've passed by a few times and never gone into. You just
stand in front of the counter and tell the lady what you're interested in, and
she finds something to recommend and sells it to you.</p>

<p>I haven't actually tried the tea yet (I would do it now, but I don't need more
caffeine at 10:30¬†pm), so I'll come back and update this when I have a report
on whether it's any good! (I'm guessing loose tea from a store that sells only
tea and that's about $0.50 per cup is going to be pretty good, but you never
know.)</p>

    <p>While I was writing examples for the on-line help of a new feature of <a
href="https://github.com/sobjornstad/dreamdir">Dreamdir</a>, Copilot (quite
remarkably) recognized what I was trying to do with the rather hackish awk
pattern <code>patsplit($4, arr, /,/) == 1 { print $0 }</code> (split a string
on commas, and use this operation's return value, informing us how many splits
were made and thus how many commas were in the line, to decide whether to show
the line or not ‚Äì completely ignoring the actual split values). It even drily
noted that ‚Äúthis is a contrived example,‚Äù which it certainly is!</p>

<img loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/copilot-awk-groker.png" alt="Copilot can read awk commands!">

<p>Only, it's not <em>quite</em> right! The return value of <code>patsplit</code>
here is 1 not if there is exactly one person in the column, but if there are
exactly two people in the column, because there would be no comma at all, and
hence zero splits, if there was only a single comma-separated value. It's
interesting that it made exactly the sort of mistake that a human programmer
would make here ‚Äì I didn't even notice the error until I actually ran the
command and looked at the output to be sure I hadn't made any syntax errors.
Indeed, there's no particular reason <code>awk</code> would have to return 0 if
there are no splits; it could easily have chosen to define the return value as
the number of elements in the resulting array, in which case Copilot's
explanation would be right; it just doesn't. (0 does have the benefit that the
return value becomes falsy if the delimiter wasn't found, though, which could
be convenient on occasion.)</p>

<div class="callout">

    Incidentally, the <code>{ print $0 }</code> isn't actually necessary: if an
    awk program consists of only one pattern with no body, the body is assumed
    to be <code>{ print $0 }</code>. I left it in here in case people reading
    the examples don't know this!)

    <p>Today I went for a walk in the Lowry Hill neighborhood, as prompted by a nifty
iPhone app called Randonautica which I use occasionally. This lets you select a
radius around your current location, then randomly picks a spot you're supposed
to go explore somewhere within it (using some amusingly woo-woo method).
Inevitably, you find something interesting in the area it instructs you to
visit, not of course because its ‚Äúmethod‚Äù actually knows where interesting
things are, but because interesting things are all around us, and we usually
aren't paying attention.</p>

<p>There was a surprisingly nice view of the skyline right at the spot it pointed
me to, although my phone camera didn't do the best job of capturing it:</p>

<img loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/minneapolis-lr-randonautica-skyline.jpg" alt="Downtown Minneapolis seen from a high spot in the Lowry Hill neighborhood">

<p>On the way back, I went through Thomas Lowry Park, named after the streetcar
magnate who made huge contributions to Minneapolis's transportation system (the
streetcar tracks have been long since paved over, to the eternal regret of
Minneapolis urbanists). I had not been there before, and had read the other day
that it has a fountain made up of a series of cascading pools. Presumably these
are them, though it was a wee bit cold for any fountain action today:</p>

blocks, was this nifty carved lamppost in front of a random house:</p>

    <div class="post-description">New stuff: fancy soup</div>
    <p>Today there's a winter storm warning, so I'm not going anywhere. Instead I
made a really intense mushroom barley soup from an amazing soup cookbook called
<em>Dairy Hollow House Soup and Bread</em>, written by a woman named (I kid you
not) <a href="https://dragonwagon.com">Crescent Dragonwagon</a>. It's
undoubtedly the richest vegan soup I've ever had ‚Äì mixed dried forest
mushrooms, button mushrooms, white wine, the typical soup vegetables (including
parsnip for that little bit of bitter zest!) and a homemade roasted vegetable
stock with extra mushroom stems.</p>

<p>Every recipe from the book I've tried is good, but many of them are quite a
production ‚Äì being recipes they make at Dragonwagon's inn's restaurant, it's
rare to find one with fewer than fifteen ingredients, and there are usually lots
of steps. This one had 19, and one of them was the stock, which itself had 10.
But if you don't think vegetable broth is good, this one will change your mind!
I would have happily sipped a cup of it if I hadn't needed all of it for the
soup. Totally worth it.</p>

<p>I'm a mushroom lover, so this recipe couldn't really be bad. It came out a
little sweeter than I would have preferred though ‚Äì next time I'm going to try
a very dry wine instead of the medium-dry the recipe called for. (It could be
partly the fault of the vegetable stock I chose, which is a touch sweet because
the veggies are caramelized.) Met expectations overall, though it only scores
that low because I have high expectations of the cookbook.</p>

    <div class="post-description">New coffee shop</div>
    <p>When I started working from home (permanently, post-pandemic-restrictions), I
had originally planned to go work somewhere else for part of the day
<em>most</em> days. As of yesterday, I had somehow managed to do that exactly
zero days on which I was otherwise based in my home office. While I'm
introverted enough that I don't get lonely from being at home all day as long
as I go hang out with other people a couple of times a week, it's definitely
still better for me to get out of my apartment most days, so I'm planning to
try out a bunch of nearby spots I could work and hopefully find a couple that I
can become a regular at.</p>

<p>One problem with working away from home is that there are some tasks I can do
way more effectively at my desk, with two 24-inch monitors, access to four
different computers running different operating systems, and a whole office
setup. I know what tasks I can do well with just my laptop, but I've often done
a bad job of block-scheduling them. So in some sense, this will be a
task-management experiment as much as a place experiment. (I do have a handy
portable 15-inch monitor that folds up to the size of a laptop and can be used
as a second screen, but I think it's a bit too nerdy to set up at a table in a
coffee shop! You also kind of have to set up an external keyboard and mouse too
if you want to run dual monitors without wrecking your ergonomics, which makes
it even more impractical.)</p>

<p>In the interest of not allowing a bunch of internet strangers to trivially
triangulate my exact home address, I won't say too much about exactly what
these places are or where they are in relation to me, but I'll drop in a
little. The coffee shop I tried today (I had been once, but not to work, and
before I actually lived in Minneapolis) somehow felt simultaneously really nice
and not quite the right vibe for me. I could imagine getting used to it, but
I'm not sure about it at this point either.</p>

    <div class="post-description">New stuff: Bogart's, Foshay Tower</div>
    <p>(For Sunday, the actual publication date.)</p>

<p>When I joined Costco last December, the guy at the customer service desk read
my address and told me I had to try Bogart's Doughnut Co., which isn't actually
that close to my apartment but was apparently his main association with Uptown.
It's right on the way from my apartment to church, but I've never stopped, so
today I did on my way home and got their brown-butter-glazed doughnut, which I
was told was the classic. It wasn't, in my opinion, <em>astoundingly</em> good,
as I had been made to believe from the way he and another woman there talked
about it, but it was solidly excellent and I'll definitely go back if I'm
craving a doughnut.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I went to the Foshay Tower downtown and went up to the museum
and observation deck. I only saw four other people, on a holiday weekend, so
the observation deck must be unusually unpopular for one situated in a major
city; it's certainly odd that the way to go up is to walk into the hotel and
ask at the front desk to pay $9 for an elevator key card (they even make you
sign on the screen, on a line that says ‚ÄúI agree to pay all room charges and
incidentals‚Äù).</p>

<p>The story of the tower, and Foshay himself, is fascinating, but I was a little
underwhelmed by the museum as a museum. It lacks any kind of clearly presented
story, and has only a couple of small slips of paper written by the curator, so
that you have to read all the newspaper articles and artifacts yourself and try
to draw your own conclusions, something which is difficult to do reliably given
that some of the articles are nearly a century old and you don't know what
motivations the writers might have had. I'm still unclear, for example, on
exactly to what extent Foshay's company was a Ponzi scheme; he clearly lied
about where the dividends he was giving out were coming from, but it seems like
he also had a real business that would have been profitable sooner or later?</p>

<p>The observation deck was fun, but you do have to temper your expectations a
bit since you're on the thirty-second story smack in the middle of a downtown
that has quite a few taller buildings. You get a great close-up view of the
buildings around you that you couldn't easily get from any nearby public space,
and there are some gaps where you can see quite a long way, including a decent
look at the skyline of St. Paul, but if there's a specific area of the city
you're hoping to glimpse, or you want a panoramic overview, you're likely to be
disappointed. I couldn't see into my own neighborhood at all; the AT&T Tower
prevents you from seeing anything to the east of Lake of the Isles and west of
Nicollet or so. Also, the telescopes at the corners were a nice touch, but a
couple of them were so dirty they were basically useless.</p>

<p>For an hour and $9, it was totally worth it, and I'd definitely recommend it
to guests.</p>

    <p>On Saturday, the weather was gorgeous and I rode the bus downtown and tried to
visit Water Power Park and maybe read for a while. This is (apparently; as you
will soon see I have not yet been there) a projection into the Mississippi
River in downtown Minneapolis near the Upper St. Anthony Locks where you can
relax and look out on the water. The park was, however, closed for unspecified
maintenance activities, despite showing as open on Google Maps. Fortunately, I
had had the idea of combining it with starting on the opposite side of the
river and walking across the Stone Arch Bridge, which is a historic rail bridge
connecting the former mills on the west side of the river to the mainline on
the east side, so the trip wasn't wasted.</p>

<p>The whole area is beautiful and I can't believe I haven't been yet. I grabbed
this picture of the skyline and the (being renovated) Central Avenue bridge
from the point where I tried unsuccessfully to enter Water Power Park. The Stone
Arch Bridge is not visible, but is off a few hundred yards to the left.</p>

<img loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/stone-arch.jpg" alt="The Central Avenue bridge">

<p>On the way back, I stopped at a used bookstore that's less than three blocks
from my apartment but which I've never been in, partly because it's only open
on Saturdays and Sundays, and bought a big stack of books. I'm not sure how
fast the inventory rotates, so I'll have to check back in a couple of months to
see how often it's worth going.</p>

    <div class="post-description">Doing new stuff: an experiment</div>
    <p>In my reflections on living in Minneapolis for a year (see post immediately
below), I noted that I want to try doing more different things, and generally
drawing more samples across all areas of my life. In the last year, I've done
about as many things around me and gotten to know about as many places as I
would have in any of the smaller towns I've lived, which makes it seem like I'm
not taking full advantage of the opportunities I have here. The new things I've
gotten have been mostly minor, like being able to attend concerts fifteen
minutes' drive from my home instead of an hour; I'm not sure I've even gone to
a whole lot more of them than I otherwise would have.</p>

<p>The world is a really interesting place with a lot of people, places, and
activities in it, and living in a city means you get a bunch of those things
packed together closely enough that you have more of them available than you'll
ever be able to explore within thirty minutes' travel. I'm not saying that I
need to aggressively try to do everything I possibly can, constantly for the
rest of my life, but especially being only around a third of the way through my
expected lifespan, it seems like I should be exploring more than I am.</p>

<p>In an attempt to adjust for this, I'm going to try to do something new every
day until the end of the year. At that point, I'll evaluate and see if I want
to continue this, maybe in some altered form. I'm not only going to count
events or places in the city, though I expect many of the items to fit in
there; I'll also count things like cooking a new recipe or meeting someone new
online. I won't, however, count reading books, visiting websites, or anything
that I would likely already have done without this project.</p>

<p>To keep myself honest, I'm going to write something here every day about what
I did under the ‚ÄúNew Stuff Experiment‚Äù tag.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCollough_effect">McCollough
effect</a> is the creepiest perceptual phenomenon I know of. By staring at
gratings made up of horizontal and vertical lines interspersed with red and
green bars, you start to see images of the same gratings separated by pure
white as having pinkish and reddish tints.</p>

<p>So far, this seems like a pretty normal afterimage demonstration, except that
the colors are the same instead of inverted. Here's the weird part: if you do
this some day, and then you put it away and come back <em>in several
months</em>, you <em>still</em> see the same illusion without doing the
induction again! (I just did a several-months-out test. It worked as
advertised.) Somehow the simple expedient of looking at some colored images for
a couple of minutes can create lasting changes in your visual perception. (If
you find this scary, know that retesting yourself repeatedly over a short
period of time will eradicate the effect; whatever adaptation occurred will
promptly undo itself once you can give your brain enough new input showing that
it's really white.)</p>

<p>Phenomena like this seem to me to provide tantalizing clues of a world ‚Äì and
a human consciousness ‚Äì that's vastly weirder and more interesting than we can
imagine.</p>

    <div class="post-description">The fundamentality of metaphor</div>
    <p>When I was in sixth grade, I, like many people, was tricked into believing
that metaphors were some kind of obscure figure found mostly in fancy poetry.
Nowadays, I believe that metaphors are the most important ‚Äì and simultaneously
among the most unrecognized ‚Äì cognitive tools available to humanity.</p>

<p>How do you learn things? By relating them to things you already know. When you
learn an unfamiliar concept, you find a concept you're familiar with, pretend
they're the same thing, and then add corrections for the things that you notice
actually aren't the same. Similarly, even once you know things, you often
reduce problems to easier ones or ideas to ones you're more comfortable with.
This happens both linguistically (the most traditional use of the word
<em>metaphor</em>) and conceptually.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I also believe this is a prime reason that fiction and friends
(legend, anecdote, etc.) are effective tools for communicating truth, or, on
the flip side, for creating untrue and/or maladaptive beliefs. Nonfiction is
honest about its metaphors, which makes it easy for the reader to accept or
reject them. Fiction just creates them and lets your brain make its own
connections while you aren't looking. Fiction is also free to use much more
creative metaphors, which are more powerful and harder to predict the effects
of.</p>

<p>Much smarter people than me have explored these ideas in much more detail
(perhaps most notably Julian Jaynes; the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor"> Conceptual
metaphor</a> article on Wikipedia provides an interesting overview of some
modern ideas), so I won't blab on any longer, but I was struck today by how
undertaught this fundamental feature of the world is and wanted to make sure my
readers had thought about this at some point!</p>

    <p>Gnomish scrollkeepers, in my roguelike, are mischievous little creatures
generated with 1‚Äì3 magical scrolls that do irritating things. A balance problem
created by this (not that the game is far enough along to have meaningful
balance yet!) is that if one doesn't find a use for all of its scrolls before
you kill it, you get to pick up the extras, and if a lot of scrollkeepers show
up, you get more scrolls than you probably should. To counter this, I decided
to make scrollkeepers have a chance of successfully lighting their scrolls on
fire as they died, to avoid their species' magic getting out and all.</p>

<p>Copilot had a‚Ä¶<em>different</em> idea:</p>

    <div class="post-description">Lazy-loading images on websites</div>
    <p>As I started adding images to this microblog, I realized I had a problem:
since the entire thing is a single page, after a while the page was going to
start downloading dozens or eventually maybe <em>hundreds</em> of images every
time someone browsed to it, most of which the reader would never look at unless
they decided to go through the archives for all of time ‚Äì hardly the
lightweight site I'm aspiring to create. I could have written some JavaScript
to load them when the reader came to them, but this also seemed ugly and not in
keeping with the philosophy of the site.</p>

<p>Happily, it turns out HTML5 added an image attribute,
<code>loading="lazy"</code>, that causes exactly the right behavior here. The
precise way the browser decides when to load images is up to the browser, but
essentially it grabs the images for only the first couple of screens of
content, and then as you scroll down it starts pre-requesting images that are
1‚Äì2 screens away. So unless you start scrolling really fast or have a really
slow network connection, you'll never know the images aren't being loaded
up-front, they'll just be there when they scroll into view.</p>

<p>This is <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=loading%3Dlazy">supported on all
major browsers</a> except Internet Explorer, and if you're still using Internet
Exploder in 2022 for anything except an old and broken enterprise website,
I'm gonna say you deserve to download a bunch of useless images.</p>

    <div class="post-description">Baby Jesus, the projectile</div>
    <p>At choir rehearsal last night, we started Michael Praetorius's
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbhNGTG-1CM">‚ÄúPsallite‚Äù</a>,
which contained the temporarily puzzling Latin phrase:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Christo Dei filio‚Ä¶puerulo iacenti in praesepio!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which the Latin-reading part of my brain decided to interpret as ‚Äúbaby Jesus,
thrown into a manger.‚Äù (It would actually have to be <em>throwing</em>, present
tense, and it would be more idiomatic to use the accusative for
<em>praesepium</em> when motion is involved, but my brain glossed over this in
its attempt to make sense of this silly reading.) I spent the next ten minutes
with an image of someone chucking a baby across the room into a manger as if
throwing a balled-up piece of paper into a wastebasket running through my head.</p>

<p>It was only when I got back to my dictionary that I finally realized I had made
the classic mistake of confusing <em>iacio</em>, to throw, and <em>iaceo</em>,
to lie (mnemonic: the lowercase letter <em>i</em> looks sort of like a person
standing up). But in looking at the dictionary entry, I also realized I had
arguably only been half wrong! The two words are closely related in both meaning
and etymology; <em>iaceo</em> is an intransitive and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stative_verb">stative</a> counterpart of
<em>iacio</em>. The sense is that when something is thrown or cast down, it
ends up lying where it was cast. Which makes a neat metaphor: Jesus was sent
forth, down from heaven, to lie in the aforementioned manger.</p>

<p>In full:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Psallite unigenito Christo Dei filio, Redemptori Domino, puerulo iacenti in praesepio!</p>

    <p style="font-style: normal;">
    Sing to the only-begotten son of God, the Christ, the Redeemer, the Lord, the little baby boy lying in a manger!

instrument or figuring out a chord progression. After moving apartments
recently, I finally found space for an electric piano, and I'm starting to play
a little bit again.</p>

<p>I've noticed several interesting things as a result. First, it's surprising
how much I remember; I was worried that, for instance, I might have to relearn
how to simultaneously read treble and bass clef, but the moment I sat down I
had no trouble with this. I'm not sure I've lost much skill at all (not that I
had a whole lot to speak of to begin with; my age was in high single digits
when I last practiced).</p>

<p>The more curious thing to me is that the difficulty of piano, as a beginner to
intermediate player, is completely different from that of most other
instruments, in two ways: First, it is quite difficult to play all of the
correct notes even in a simple piece with a reasonable tempo; on most
instruments, playing the right notes is fairly trivial with even a small amount
of skill, unless you're playing something virtuosic. Second, once you do manage
to play all of the correct notes, it usually sounds quite good without having
to do much else (except perhaps push the pedal a few times, which doesn't
really require practice for simple pieces once you've learned how to do it
once). Of course you can continue to improve your articulation and dynamics and
so on for a lifetime, but so long as you can hit the right notes, you can
accompany yourself or someone else and not be embarrassed.</p>

<p>Contrast this with, say, the violin, where someone with a couple of weeks of
practice can easily play any melody and hit the correct notes (albeit out of
tune), but will still sound like a dying cat for probably months.</p>

<p>Much of the difficulty of hitting the right notes on the piano is down to
multitasking. There are just a lot more of them, to start with. And then
there's combining two hands doing different things. Playing with one hand
alone, I might have to stop and work out a few fingerings and land my fingers
in the right place, but this tends to be straightforward; it takes a little bit
of practice, but it isn't usually <em>difficult</em>. But as soon as I put two
hands together ‚Äì even when the rhythms are basically aligned, or with straight
half notes in the bass ‚Äì suddenly I start making all kinds of mistakes I
wouldn't have made before.</p>

<p>Lastly, at my skill level, practicing is very rewarding: I can go from being
completely unable to play something simple to sounding quite good in just a
couple of days. This is hard to achieve on any other instrument I've played.</p>

    <div class="post-description">Why I don't outline my essays</div>
    <p>Many people seem to recommend making an outline, or some kind of prepared
description of what one is going to write, before starting to write it.</p>

<p>This has never worked for me. I've tried many times, because it <em>seems</em>
like it ought to be helpful, and many people say it helps keep them focused,
but I've never found it helpful. In fact, I'm rarely able to make a useful
outline to begin with, and that has always made me feel like a sloppy thinker ‚Äì
but I seem to get good results flying by the seat of my pants, and it's hard to
argue with results.</p>

<p>As I was refilling the soap dispenser in my bathroom this morning, I suddenly
identified the fundamental problem for me: the way I normally write, I don't
know what I think about a topic, and thus what I want to say about it, until I
finish writing ‚Äì and not just a few words about each of the ideas of that
topic, the actual, final form. If I already knew what I was going to say, in
many cases I wouldn't bother to write it (it's handy that writing can be so
easily shared and both help other people and generate new connections for the
author, but the main reason I write is to figure out what I think). So too,
there wouldn't be much point in outlining anyway, because if I already knew
what I was going to say, why not just‚Ä¶write it down?</p>

<p>Or put another way, it almost <em>never</em> happens that I sit down to write
something and don't end up getting up from the keyboard thinking something
substantially different ‚Äì and much more expansive ‚Äì than I did when I sat down;
and this is true even when I am pretty sure I know what I think. I certainly
did not, for example, expect this post to be seven paragraphs long, or to talk
about my penchant for leaving sentences unfinished or the way people are taught
to write in school; I only discovered many of the important ideas here as I
started describing my soap-dispenser revelation.</p>

<p>If I'm writing something much longer than an essay, I do routinely note down
ideas that I think I want to include later so that I don't forget about them.
But I wouldn't call this an <em>outline</em>; it's more like a to-do list,
because I don't make any attempt to figure out how the structure fits together
at this point, and I'm not necessarily planning to include all of the ideas. I
also, in writing of all lengths, often leave sentences hanging and unfinished
and go write something different on another line or in another paragraph, when
I suddenly think of a new idea I should mention. In a way this is <em>kind
of</em> like outlining in that I leave placeholders for things I want to expand
later. But unlike traditional outlines, it encourages iterating in place,
rather than trying to get the structure right the first time without any
details. Here's an example of an earlier version of this post:</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="assets/images/unfinished-outline.png" alt="A partially written post, demonstrating how I leave sentences half-finished.">

<p>This whole thing strikes me as a manifestation of the
<a href="http://562.nz/#BrokenAcademicWritingProcess">waterfall writing process problem</a>,
where the way one is encouraged or required to write actively discourages
changing one's mind or restructuring one's argument later. The way people are
taught to write in school targets, essentially, content-farm writing, rather
than writing that follows natural curiosity and leads to real insights and
worthwhile output (I would call this <em>creative writing</em>, but that's an
established term that means something different).</p>

<p>Maybe I'm just weird here? I do seem to think in language more naturally and
preferentially than some people.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a> is often
stupid, making incredibly basic mistakes like referencing variables that don't
exist (I'm surprised they haven't figured out how to integrate it with the IDE
autocomplete ‚Äì although maybe it does and the model just likes to ignore it
sometimes). At other times, it instantly figures things out that a human would
need some significant domain knowledge to work out, to the point that it's hard
to believe it's just a fancy language model.</p>

<p>In my roguelike recently, moving up against the edge of the map was doing
nothing. I wanted to add a message that said ‚ÄúYou are at the edge of the world‚Äù
when you did this. Here's what I got after adding a conditional for whether
there is no adjacent tile in the specified direction:</p>

<p>(Incidentally, my experience has been that Copilot works noticeably better
with Python than with TypeScript. I suspect this is because I use docstrings
extensively in Python and it's remarkably good at interpreting them.)</p>

    <div class="post-description">Required optional types and non-covariate unions</div>
    <p>I sometimes find myself wanting a ‚Äúrequired optional‚Äù type in MyPy or
TypeScript. That is, the variable can be either null or some type, but the code
shouldn't compile if there's no way for the parameter or return type to be
non-null; there has to be some code path in which it could have a value (to
figure this out without actually running the code, a true
<code>Optional[T]</code> would have to be illegal to assign to a
<code>RequiredOptional[T]</code>, but a <code>RequiredOptional[T]</code> could
be assigned to an <code>Optional[T]</code> ‚Äì this is nothing new, just as a
<code>T</code> can be assigned to an <code>Optional[T]</code> but an
<code>Optional[T]</code> can't be assigned to a <code>T</code>).</p>

<p>Here's a recent example of an error this could catch: I'm working on writing a
toy roguelike, and a common need throughout is for various NPCs to move around.
To handle this, I have functions called <em>travel behaviors</em> that are
assigned to each NPC and can be changed at any time; the behavior function is
called to determine where the NPC should move. Here's a generic one that tries
to move to a specific tile:</p>

<pre><code>def travel_towards_target(
        soul: Soul,
        target: Tile,
        when_target_reached: Callable[[Soul], Optional[Tile]]
        ) -> Optional[Tile]:
    if soul.tile == target:
        return when_target_reached(soul)
    path = shortest_path(soul.tile, target)
    return path[0] if shortest_path is not None else None
</code></pre>

<p>When the NPC gets a move, it (the <code>soul</code> parameter) tries to move
to the next tile along the shortest path from its current tile to the target
tile. If the target is unreachable, it returns <code>None</code> to indicate it
won't move at all (in reality we'd probably also want to change behaviors here,
but this is an example). This results in a return type of
<code>Optional[Tile]</code>, that is, either a <code>Tile</code> or
<code>None</code> (Python's null value).</p>

<p>Of course, without some intervention, when an NPC reached the target tile, it
would just get stuck there forever, so if it's already there, a callback
function <code>when_target_reached()</code> is called. This function resets the
NPC's travel behavior in some way, perhaps shows the player a message, and then
returns the first action it's going to take under the new behavior (since it
still has a turn). It does this by calling <code>swap_travel_behavior()</code>,
which both changes the travel behavior function and <em>returns</em> it so that
we can call it once immediately to get this turn's action.</p>

<pre><code>def on_target_reached(soul: Soul) -> Optional[Tile]:
    # ...change the target
    say("Changed target.")
    return swap_travel_behavior(soul, my_new_behavior)()
</code></pre>

<p>But today, I inadvertently left off the return statement, resulting in an
implicit return value of <code>None</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def on_target_reached(soul: Soul) -> Optional[Tile]:
    # ...change the target
    say("Changed target.")
</code></pre>

<p>This is clearly wrong, and not just because I obviously forgot a statement. It
doesn't make any sense for the body of this function to be incapable of
returning anything other than <code>None</code>; if that was what I had wanted,
I would have just set the return type to <code>None</code>. In other words, the
return type of this function should be not ‚Äúeither a <code>Tile</code> or
<code>None</code>, or both‚Äù, as it currently is, but specifically
<em>both</em>, a union of <code>None</code> and something else
(<code>Optional[Tile]</code> being essentially an alias of <code>Union[Tile,
None]</code>), with both possibilities obtainable from the code inside the
behavior function.</p>

<p>However, as far as I'm aware, there's no way to define such a type, which
means this (actually fairly common) error can never be caught by the type
checker. This is, I suppose, a more general limitation of unions; in both MyPy
and TypeScript they're implicitly covariant as return types.</p>

<p>Ultimately, though, I doubt this would actually be a worthwhile feature! It's
already
<a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/">
hard enough to think about nullable types</a> without adding a different kind of
nullable type, and I suspect in most places this kind of checking would be
perceived as overly pedantic rather than helpful. (Witness PowerShell's
‚Äú<a href="https://powershellexplained.com/2018-12-23-Powershell-null-everything-you-wanted-to-know/#empty-null">empty null</a>.‚Äù

differently than the others.‚Äù)</p>

    <p>My small urban grocery store doesn't carry the kind of sponges I like, so I
ordered a $20 box of them on Amazon. Yesterday I got a message indicating that
they were unable to deliver the sponges ‚Äì the kind you get when the package
requires a signature and you aren't there. Then today, they came back while I
was out, and the driver called me to ask where he should leave it, as if it was
some expensive piece of equipment that would get stolen and create a disaster
if it was left out.</p>

<p>When I got back and opened the box, I found it was double-boxed, with
twenty-four air packs around the inner box, to protect the fragile sponges from
breaking.</p>

    <p>One of the best minor quality-of-life upgrades I've found lately has been
buying a physical volume knob for my desktop computer. I ran the outputs for my
headphones and my stereo system through a splitter switch, then through the
volume knob on the way to the computer's output, so the volume knob can be used
to adjust both outputs without having to unplug and reconnect anything. The
knob is vastly superior to my previous methods (press a fiddly button on a
remote control a gazillion times for the stereo, and go click on the audio icon
in the system tray for the headphones; my keyboard doesn't have volume
controls).</p>

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/volume.jpg" width=400 alt="Volume control knob, splitter switch, and webcam switch on a desk.">

<p>The upper-right box is a USB switch that I use to disconnect the power to my
webcam when I'm not working, to make sure nobody can see and hear in my
living room at off hours accidentally. I used putty to easily affix all the
controls to the desk so they don't slide around.</p>

<p>This whole setup was about $75, which might seem a little steep, but I'm
playing music, podcasts, work calls, or something else through the computer
pretty much anytime I'm in my office or kitchen (which also covers large
portions of my off hours), and I often have to adjust the volume multiple times
an hour, so it's approximately $0 per annoyance point removed once you multiply
it out over a few weeks.</p>

that's become popular lately.
They're definitely more expensive, and until these came along,
I'd never seen any benefit in buying anything
but the cheapest available cable ‚Äì
most of the high-end cables have been sold with marketing gimmicks
instead of improvements anyone would ever notice.
But these look better and last longer than traditional cables.
They tangle much less easily,
and they're less susceptible to electromagnetic interference
(though I can't say I've ever had trouble with interference on a cable in my home,
 even a 20-foot audio cable).
Give them a try next time you see one as an option!</p>

        Postscript and counterpoint to my contraceptives article (see <a
href="#post-2">#2</a>): as this article highlights, the primary cause of
‚Äúcondom failure‚Äù is <em>not using one</em>. To be clear, this doesn't
contradict anything I said in my article; I was then and am now in favor of
using condoms, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, and the 98% perfect-use effectiveness
rate this article crows about is not so great once you multiply it out over
many years (which is the focus of my article). I think most people who
regularly have sex that could result in someone getting (unintentionally)
pregnant should use something more effective instead of or in addition to
condoms, if practical. Nevertheless, this article epitomizes a broadly
important point, that, in this realm as in the rest of life, most people leave
shockingly easy gains on the table; simply, you know, <em>using the condoms at
all</em> will reduce your chances of unintended pregnancy well past those of an
average person.

        Topic: <strong>A word or phrase for this maladaptive pattern of motivation</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>I'm searching for a concise way to describe a pattern I've started noticing, in
which someone wants to achieve a particular goal A, or likes a particular
process or activity in total, but is incapable of, scared of, or strongly
dislikes a necessary component or step of that goal/process/activity A&prime;,
creating an infuriating tension and an obstacle to progress.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Alice joined a fantasy football league for the first time last year.
        She enjoyed it, but really didn't like the research and draft process.
        She's not sure if she can get herself to go through it again,
        so she might not play this year.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bob really wants to get married and start a family, but he hates dating,
        so he's struggling to make any progress.
    </li>
    <li>
        Carol is considering accepting a promotion
        and would like to continue climbing the ladder,
        but she doesn't want a particular responsibility
        that's an integral part of the next step.
        She consequently has major qualms about accepting,
        but also can't stand turning it down.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This could conceivably be phrased as an emotional condition of the person, or
as an attribute of step A&prime;: Alice, Bob, and Carol are experiencing
________ ‚Äî<em>or</em>‚Äî  The draft is a ________ for Alice's enjoyment of
fantasy football.</p>

<p>This concept is distinct from <em>laziness</em> in that the reason is much
more deep-seated than not wanting to put in work; it's not that the task
requires more effort or time than one wants to expend, it's that it's somehow
distasteful. It's closer to <em>akrasia</em>, in which one acts against one's
better judgment or will, but different in that there are two distinct
components to the mystery concept; in akrasia one knows one should do A and
doesn't want to do it, while here one knows one should do A <em>and actively
wants to do it</em>, perhaps desperately, but doesn't want to do A&prime;, which
is a necessary component or dependency of A.</p>

<p>Is there an existing term or concept representing this idea or something
close to it? Or can you think of a clever way to describe it?</p>

        Topic: <strong>Fiction involving shared consciousness</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>I'm fascinated by fiction about or involving telepathy or sharing of
consciousness between characters, especially when used creatively or to
enjoy/strengthen a relationship with someone. Looking for leads on
more stories fitting this description!</p>

<p>Doesn't have to be exclusively humans, can also involve supernatural beings,
aliens, alters, computers, or something weirder I haven't imagined yet; but the
motivations of at least one participant should ideally be recognizable as
human-ish. I'm hoping for a significant part of the story to involve the
personal experience and/or interpersonal or sociological consequences of such
capabilities/contacts. Stories merely including the trope in some corner are
probably not what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>A few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>His Dark Materials</em>, Philip Pullman
    (people have animal-formed companions called daemons
     who are mentally linked to their humans)</li>
<li><em>Slapstick</em>, Kurt Vonnegut
    (Wilbur and Eliza are fraternal twins who are mentally disabled when apart,
     but explosive geniuses when they are close enough to share their minds)</li>
<li><em>Inception</em>, Christopher Nolan
    (people can share their dream worlds with others)</li>
<li><em>Being John Malkovich</em>, Spike Jonze/Charlie Kaufman
    (people can temporarily join John Malkovich inside his head)</li>
</ul>

<p>(Not sure about <em>Ender's Game</em>. I've only read the first novel, which
hints at interesting ideas but doesn't yield up much on the personal experience
or interpersonal/sociological consequences; the consequences for the plot of
the Buggers'/Formics' collective consciousness are also entirely predictable.
Is there enough in later books to be worth reading with this theme in mind? If
so, which ones?)</p>

        There is no secret math. The biggest mistake people make with statistics is to
distrust their intuition. In reality, once you do all the math, the things that
seemed like they‚Äôd be problems are in fact problems. If anything, the math just
turns up more things to worry about.

        As explained in the popular consciousness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, some things
are more or less evenly distributed and you can think about them in averages,
while other things are very unevenly distributed, to the point where only the
outliers matter. Kuhn usefully terms these ‚Äúlight-tailed‚Äù and ‚Äúheavy-tailed‚Äù
distributions and points out that many if not most of the important
distributions in an individual‚Äôs life are heavy-tailed (jobs, romantic
relationships, business ideas, leisure activities, etc.). Then he explores
strategies for improving your chances of obtaining a good outcome from
heavy-tailed distributions in your life.

        Most people don't have an intuitive understanding of how small risks add up over time.
When sex, bad statistics, and bad public-health messaging are thrown into the mix,
    people end up making bad decisions.
In this article, spreadsheet simulator, and demo video,
    we explore the chances of unintended pregnancy over a person's lifetime
    ‚Äì which are almost certainly higher than you think if you're never looked into it ‚Äì
    and what you can do to reduce them.
(I got interested in this topic on a whim after reading a history of AIDS
 had me thinking constantly about sexual health messaging for about a solid week.)

        Since I quit regularly using most social media, I haven't missed the ads or
political screaming one bit, but I have found I miss being able to easily share
random interesting things with the world. I'm hoping to resolve this and
recapture a bit of the energy of Web 1.0 by posting on a simple website
instead; perhaps a few people will still be interested enough to follow a
website or RSS feed (remember those? I still use them!). This weekend, I wrote
a tiny, <a
href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/likable/">likable</a>
tool called attopublish to manage the posts, and I'll tweak it as needed.
attopublish will also be available as an open-source tool sooner or later for
anyone who's interested.
