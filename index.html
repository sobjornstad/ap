        <p>
I'm fascinated by and looking for fiction about or involving telepathy or
sharing of consciousness between characters, especially when used creatively or
to enjoy/strengthen a relationship with someone. Doesn't have to be exclusively
humans, can also involve supernatural beings, aliens, alters, computers, or
something weirder I haven't imagined; but the motivations of at least one
participant should be recognizable as human-ish.
</p><p>
I'm hoping for a significant part of the story to involve the personal
experience and/or interpersonal or sociological consequences of such
capabilities/contacts. Merely including the trope in some corner is probably
not what I'm looking for.
</p><p>
A few examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>His Dark Materials</em>, Philip Pullman
    (humans have animal-formed companions called daemons
     who are mentally linked to their humans)</li>
<li><em>Slapstick</em>, Kurt Vonnegut
    (Wilbur and Eliza are fraternal twins who are mentally disabled when apart,
     but explosive geniuses when they are close enough to share their minds)</li>
<li><em>Inception</em>, Christopher Nolan
    (people can share their dream worlds with others)</li>
<li><em>Being John Malkovich</em>, Spike Jonze/Charlie Kaufman
    (people can temporarily join John Malkovich inside his head)</li>
</ul>
<p>
(Not sure about <em>Ender's Game</em>. I've only read the first novel, which
hints at interesting ideas but doesn't yield up much on the personal experience
or interpersonal/sociological consequences; the consequences for the plot of
the Buggers'/Formics' collective consciousness are also entirely predictable.
Is there enough in later books to be worth reading with this theme in mind? If
so, which ones?)

        There is no secret math. The biggest mistake people make with statistics is to
distrust their intuition. In reality, once you do all the math, the things that
seemed like they‚Äôd be problems are in fact problems. If anything, the math just
turns up more things to worry about.

    </div>
    <p>
        As explained in the popular consciousness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, some things
are more or less evenly distributed and you can think about them in averages,
while other things are very unevenly distributed, to the point where only the
outliers matter. Kuhn usefully terms these ‚Äúlight-tailed‚Äù and ‚Äúheavy-tailed‚Äù
distributions and points out that many if not most of the important
distributions in an individual‚Äôs life are heavy-tailed (jobs, romantic
relationships, business ideas, leisure activities, etc.). Then he explores
strategies for improving your chances of obtaining a good outcome from
heavy-tailed distributions in your life.

        One way I often like to think about behavioral questions is this: if everyone
followed in these footsteps, would it make the whole organization (or community)
overall better or worse?

        </a>
    </div>
    <p>
        Most people don't have an intuitive understanding of how small risks add up over time.
    When sex, bad statistics, and bad public-health messaging are thrown into the mix,
    people end up making bad decisions.
    In this article, spreadsheet simulator, and demo video,
    we explore the chances of unintended pregnancy over a person's lifetime
    ‚Äì which are almost certainly higher than you think if you're never looked into it ‚Äì
    and what you can do to reduce them.
    (I got interested in this topic on a whim after reading a history of AIDS
     had me thinking constantly about sexual health messaging for about a solid week.)

        Since I quit regularly using most social media, I haven't missed the ads or
political screaming one bit, but I have found I miss being able to easily share
random interesting things with the world. I'm hoping to resolve this and
recapture a bit of the energy of Web 1.0 by posting on a simple website
instead; perhaps a few people will still be interested enough to follow a
website or RSS feed (remember those? I still use them!). This weekend, I wrote
a tiny, <a
href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/likable/">likable</a>
tool called attopublish to manage the posts, and I'll tweak it as needed.
attopublish will also be available as an open-source tool sooner or later for
anyone who's interested.
