        One way I often like to think about behavioral questions is this: if everyone
followed in these footsteps, would it make the whole organization (or community)
overall better or worse?

        I believe I have reached peak Minnesota Nice after living here for 9 years.  I
was walking across the parking lot of a gas station today, and some dingbat
nearly backed up into me.  Normally I wouldn't mind too much since I was cutting
across a parking lot, which is after all shared space between cars and
pedestrians, but this dude was literally looking straight forward out of his
windshield while backing up. I stepped over to his open window and said
cheerfully through it, ‚ÄúExcuse me, could you look behind you while you're
backing up, please?‚Äù

This is a conversation with someone who is trying to scam you.

    </div>
    <p>
        Most people don't have an intuitive understanding of how small risks add up over time.
    When sex, bad statistics, and bad public-health messaging are thrown into the mix,
    people end up making bad decisions.
    In this article, spreadsheet simulator, and demo video,
    we explore your chances of unintended pregnancy over a lifetime
    and what you can do to reduce them.
    (I got interested in this topic on a whim after reading a history of AIDS
     had me thinking constantly about sexual health messaging for about a solid week.)
