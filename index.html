            üîó Searching for outliers
        </a> (Ben Kuhn)
    </div>
    <p>
        As explained in the popular consciousness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, some things
are more or less evenly distributed and you can think about them in averages,
while other things are very unevenly distributed, to the point where only the
outliers matter. Kuhn usefully terms these ‚Äúlight-tailed‚Äù and ‚Äúheavy-tailed‚Äù
distributions and points out that many if not most of the important
distributions in an individual‚Äôs life are heavy-tailed (jobs, romantic
relationships, business ideas, enjoyability of leisure activities). Then he
explores strategies for improving your chances of obtaining a good outcome from
heavy-tailed distributions in your life.

        One way I often like to think about behavioral questions is this: if everyone
followed in these footsteps, would it make the whole organization (or community)
overall better or worse?

        I believe I have reached peak Minnesota Nice after living here for 9 years.  I
was walking across the parking lot of a gas station today, and some dingbat
nearly backed up into me.  Normally I wouldn't mind too much since I was cutting
across a parking lot, which is after all shared space between cars and
pedestrians, but this dude was literally looking straight forward out of his
windshield while backing up. I stepped over to his open window and said
cheerfully through it, ‚ÄúExcuse me, could you look behind you while you're
backing up, please?‚Äù

        </a>
    </div>
    <p>
        Most people don't have an intuitive understanding of how small risks add up over time.
    When sex, bad statistics, and bad public-health messaging are thrown into the mix,
    people end up making bad decisions.
    In this article, spreadsheet simulator, and demo video,
    we explore your chances of unintended pregnancy over a lifetime
    and what you can do to reduce them.
    (I got interested in this topic on a whim after reading a history of AIDS
     had me thinking constantly about sexual health messaging for about a solid week.)
