it literally means “the the angels angels.”

    :shortdes: Boring investment advice
    :tags: Finance | Life

.A few of my friends have been asking me for advice on getting started investing lately,
so I thought I'd write it up instead of explaining it over and over again.

.There are two ways you can get rich through investments:

<ol>
<li>
    Spend a lot of time looking for opportunities to outperform.
    Be unusually good at that.
    Lose money on a lot of bad investments,
    and make a killing on a couple good ones that make up for the losses and then some.
    This might happen in 1&nbsp;year or 100&nbsp;years.
</li>
<li>
    Don't think about it at all.
    Put as much money as you can afford to in some funds that track the economy as a whole
    (or some large sector of it; we call these “index funds”).
    Keep doing that for 30&nbsp;years.
</li>
</ol>

.If you're the kind of person who's really well suited to do #1, OK, go for it.
If you're asking me for advice, though, you are almost certainly better suited for #2,
so give up the idea of #1 right now –
it's probably intimidating you into not getting started.

.The economy as a whole isn't a perfectly safe bet, of course,
but it's probably more likely to stay on a decently positive trajectory than any other thing you could pick.
You're also very unlikely to ever curse your stupidity for investing in it,
which cannot be said for most other choices.
You won't ever do as well as you possibly could with this approach,
but the average case is much, much better, and it earns more than enough to satisfy most people.
You only get one life – go for a solid average, not a super-high-variance approach.

<div class="callout">

If you actually like the idea of #1,
set aside 10% of the money you want to invest for that approach
and treat it like you're bringing money to Vegas:
if you win, sweet,
and if you lose, no big deal,
you only put aside the money you could afford to lose,
and you can write it off as the cost of entertainment.

</div>


.A couple principles for implementing #2:

.<strong>Time in the market beats everything else.</strong>
On average, if you invest $100 a month from age 25 to 35 into something reliable and then never save another penny and just let it ride,
you end up with more money at age 65 than if you invest $100 a month from age 35 to 65!
This sucks because that's also the time most people are least able to put aside money,
but unfortunately it's hard to argue math into being fairer (let me know if you find a way).
If you have a steady income, figure out how much you can afford to throw in and set up a monthly or biweekly automatic withdrawal so you never even have to think about it.
<a href="https://mosmu.se/#PowerOfKonsistency">Getting started and being consistent beat volume.</a>

.<strong>Don't change your course depending on how your investments are doing.</strong>
This approach does not require you to follow the news or switch from idea to idea all the time –
so if you don't trust yourself not to change course,
don't even look at how you're doing.
(Probably once a year or so you should double-check
 that you're still periodically saving the amount you thought you were
 in the investments you thought you were.
 Otherwise, no need.)
Losses aren't real until you withdraw the money or switch it to a different investment;
that's when you lock in your loss.
And if your bet on the economy was ever good in the long run, it's still good during a temporary downturn.
So just wait; there's a good chance the number will be back up again by the time you need the money.

.<strong>You are not going to be smart enough to time the market</strong> and make extra money.
Even people who get paid six figures to do this full-time usually aren't!
So just keep throwing in money regularly whether the market is up or down.
Sometimes you'll invest on a day where the market drops precipitously after you invest, and you could have done better.
But sometimes you'll invest on a day where the market just took a huge dip, and you make a bunch of extra money when it goes back up the next day.
When you split your investing into a dozen or two purchases every year, it evens out in the long run.
Similarly, don't hold back money that you would be investing for a later date when it “looks like a good time to invest.”
Yes, sometimes you could outperform this way,
but people have simulated this scenario and found that your average gain is highest when you just dump the money immediately
(even if it's a windfall of a couple hundred thousand dollars and this feels much riskier),
because on average the market goes up,
and you're more likely to miss out on easy gains than anything else.
(Plus, remember that time in the market beats everything else?
 You're losing time in the market.)

.And a few boring mechanics:

.Most people in the United States should start with a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> account.
You can put up to $7,000 a year in one.
(There are <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/smart-money/roth-ira-income-limits">income eligibility limits</a>;
 if you make more than $150,000 a year, you should go check on these first.)
You can't easily withdraw Roth IRA gains until you reach retirement age,
but you never have to pay any tax on the gains,
which makes your money go at least 15% further.
And you can withdraw whatever you put in tax- and penalty-free at any time,
so if you don't have much money to invest you could
put some general-purpose savings in a Roth IRA.
Hopefully you won't need the money back and you can keep it invested,
but if you do you can yank it again and you'll still get to keep any gains tax-free.
(Ideally, of course, you would both save some short-term money and make some long-term investments.
 But getting started as soon as possible is the most important thing!)

.The exception to this is if your employer offers a retirement plan with matching funds,
where you put in some amount of money and they add some of their own.
This is basically free money,
so if you have access to such a plan and you're not contributing enough to get the full match,
you should do that first.

<div class="callout">

.Sometimes people wonder if they shouldn't put some of their money into a non-retirement account first,
because they don't want to wait until retirement age to have more money.
I think the answer is usually no.
If you're going to need the money in the next couple of years,
you probably shouldn't be investing it anyway;
if the market drops, you won't have enough time to make it back.
(You could put it in a high-interest savings account, or maybe a CD or government bonds.)
If you're thinking more along the lines of having lots of money in a decade or two,
I think it usually comes out better to go really hard on your retirement accounts first.
Your income is probably going to go up in the intervening years
unless you have plans to make a big career change,
so you might not need investment money then at all,
and meanwhile you'll be giving your retirement money time to grow tax-free.
If you get too far ahead,
you can just stop adding money to your retirement accounts
and spend that money on something else.

.(If you end up with enough money that you can retire very early,
there are also some ways
to get money out of your US retirement accounts early without paying a penalty;
you can worry about that if you end up needing it.)

.It's also worth noting that non-retirement investment accounts
have a bunch of complicated tax considerations,
which will make getting started much more annoying.

.As always, I'm sure you could come up with some scenario
where using the retirement account first isn't the right choice,
but unless you have an obvious one,
you probably shouldn't worry about this.
</div>

.As for <strong>what company to open your investment accounts with</strong>
– you won't go wrong with
either <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com">Vanguard</a>
or <a href="https://www.fidelity.com">Fidelity</a>.
Vanguard has been in the business for much longer (they basically invented index funds)
and is shareholder-owned, which is pretty cool.
Fidelity offers a bunch of other financial products as well,
so you might be able to consolidate a bunch of your accounts there if you like that idea,
and most people think their website is a little easier to use.

.<strong>What funds, specifically, to invest in?</strong>
You can make this topic pretty much as complex as you want.
But if you're just starting out, I'd suggest a target date fund.
You pick a year close to when you expect to retire
(for instance, if you're 30 years old today and you expect to retire around age 65,
 you might pick a 2060 fund),
and the fund managers will distribute your money over their other index funds
based on how far you are from that target date
(you want to invest in safer things
 when there's a shorter time horizon
 because there's less time to recover from losses,
 but riskier things
 when there's a sufficiently long one
 because you'll earn more money on average).
You pick the fund once and you're done (except for continuing to add money).

.You can likely do marginally better if you know what you're doing,
but again, if you're asking me for investment advice because you're clueless,
you should start out as simple as possible,
and if you get curious and want to nerd out, you can start adding complexity later.
Someone who consistently uses a target date fund will <em>vastly</em> outperform the average person already,
and someone who dives into the details will usually do only very slightly better.

.Make sure the target date fund is low-fee;
not much work goes into managing one,
so they shouldn't be taking more than ~0.10% of your money.
All the Vanguard and Fidelity ones are fine.

    :shortdes: What about the climate impact of Bitcoin mining?
    :tags: Society | Tech

.Seeing how silly the <a href="#post-223">ChatGPT energy usage claim</a> was, I
remembered that I've been shocked in the past by how energy-intensive Bitcoin
mining is, so I figured I'd better double-check that one. Using numbers from
the other Substack post, plus the links provided:

<ul>
    <li>Total energy use of the Internet: ~800 TWh per year</li>
    <li>Total energy use of Bitcoin mining: ~<a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption">175 TWh per year</a></li>
    <li>Total energy use of ChatGPT, if we replaced every Google search with a ChatGPT query (way more than actual usage): 2.2 TWh per year</li>
</ul>

.So Bitcoin mining uses 80 times as much energy as this overestimate of ChatGPT
usage.

.If it taught us nothing else, though, the ChatGPT claim hopefully reminded us
of the danger of not understanding the scale of our base values, so how much
energy is the Internet using?

.Total global energy use <a
href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-consumption">is about
180,000 TWh per year</a>, so the Internet is responsible for about 0.45% of
total global energy consumption. If you apportion the energy consumption of the
Internet equally to each of its ~5 billion users, that comes to about 160 KWh
per person per year, equivalent to about 3 weeks of running a space heater on
medium during office hours, or driving a moderately efficient electric car
about 480 miles.

.The energy use of Bitcoin mining is about one-quarter that of the Internet, so
it's around 1/1000th of global energy usage, or like each Internet user driving
120 extra miles each year. Given that the existence of Bitcoin doesn't seem to
have had huge positive effects on the world overall, I think there's a case for
considering Bitcoin a poor use of energy, but it also doesn't seem wildly
alarming yet. And it's about in line with the level of “energy waster” I had
given it in my head.

<div class="callout">

.Is 160 KWh per year a surprisingly large amount of energy for your Internet
use? It surprised me, at any rate; virtual things seldom feel like they would
have much real-world environmental impact. And I bet most people reading this
should peg their Internet energy usage as quite a lot more than the average
user. There's a big difference in energy consumption between an “Internet User”
in the developing world who reads Facebook for an hour a day on their phone and
a professional who uses a full-size laptop or even a high-powered desktop
computer to access the Internet for 12 hours a day for work and leisure.

.That said, compared to the impact of what you might be doing if you weren't
using the Internet – say, going to the store and buying a physical book, or
flying to another city for a meeting – it's likely a good trade.

    :shortdes: Claims about AI's impact on climate are misleading and distracting
    :tags: AI | Society | Tech

.Claims that ChatGPT or other LLM or AI tools use a ridiculous amount of energy
and/or water have been making the rounds recently. They are very misleading.

.It's true that ChatGPT uses an eye-popping amount of energy when
compared to the amount of energy you use in your everyday life. For instance,
you may have seen headlines that ChatGPT “uses as much energy as 20,000
households.” But that's kind of like remarking that New York City uses a
ridiculous amount of energy compared to you – <em>obviously</em> it does,
because there are millions of people in New York and only one of you. Millions
of people use ChatGPT, so yeah, the aggregated energy usage is going to be
high. But if we compare it to something that operates on a similar scale, it
looks totally normal, or even outright good; for instance, Netflix uses
hundreds of times as much energy as ChatGPT!

.To be clear, I think there are many good reasons to be wary of AI. Even if all
progress in AI stopped tomorrow (which is obviously not going to happen),
society would still change quite a lot just with the new tech that we've
already got and haven't figured out how to use well yet. And it's quite
possible that the next couple generations of LLMs will start putting relatively
high-skilled people out of jobs, or just leading people to question their own
value when they're no longer better than a computer at most or all of their
skills. This is not even to mention the very real possibility that further AI
development will cause major catastrophes or even permanently usurp humanity as
the primary controller of our planet.

.But it's precisely because these reasons for skepticism exist that I have no
patience at all for the climate angle. If the real problem is that we might
want to attempt restrictions on AI development or change the way we approach AI
because it might fundamentally change society and our relationship to the world
in a way that humanity collectively does not want, can we talk about
<em>that</em> instead of trying to convince people that ChatGPT uses too much
electricity? People have a limited amount of energy to attend to moral or
practical objections to everyday things; we shouldn't waste it on silly ones.
Frankly, even if ChatGPT did use a crazy amount of electricity, that wouldn't
be the best angle to approach the question from given the comparative stakes,
but given that it doesn't, spending any time at all on it is disingenuous and
dangerous.

.Andy Masley has an <a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/p/individual-ai-use-is-not-bad-for">
extremely thorough debunking
</a>
of the claim on his Substack, but if you don't have half an hour for that,
here are a few choice comparisons:

<img class="center" width="640" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/andymasley.png">

(In the graph, the activities that don't show a time or number of uses represent 1 year of that activity.)

<blockquote>
If OpenAI didn't train GPT-4, that would be about the same as there being no flights between New York [and] San Francisco for about 2 days. That's not 2 days per week. It's 2 days total. Even if ChatGPT had to be retrained every year (and remember, it doesn't) that is less than 1% of the emissions from flights between these two specific American cities. How much of our collective effort is it worth to stop this?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Video streaming is using 1,600 times as much energy as ChatGPT, but we don’t hear about it as much because it’s a much more normal part of everyday life. 20,000 households can sound like a crazy number when you compare it to your individual life, but it’s incredibly small by the standards of internet energy use.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
If we assume every...American uses a digital clock, then American digital clocks are using at minimum 1,100 Olympic swimming pools of water each year. That’s a shocking statistic if we don’t contextualize it with how much water is used in our energy system in general. The American energy sector as a whole uses 200 trillion liters of water each year, enough for [80,000,000] Olympic swimming pools. ChatGPT is using 1,500 Olympic swimming pools of water (with the water used for energy included), or 0.002% of America’s total water used for energy.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

    .If I wanted to reduce my water use by 600 gallons, I could:

    <ul>
        <li>Skip sending 200,000 ChatGPT queries, or 50 queries every single day for a decade.</li>
        <li>Skip listening to ~2 hours of streaming music every single day for a decade.</li>
        <li>Skip 1 burger.</li>
    </ul>

    :shortdes: Rope around the Earth
    :tags: Brainteaser | Math

.Here's a simple math problem that messes with your intuition. Suppose you have
some rope, and a loop of it is wrapped snugly once around your arm. Now you
want to feed more rope into the loop so that it encircles your arm with
1&nbsp;foot of space between the rope and your arm. How much more rope will you
need?

.Well, when the rope is wrapped tightly around your arm, it forms a circle
(roughly, anyway) with some radius of \( r \) feet (probably fractional unless
you have extremely thick arms). The circumference of this circle \( C \) then
represents the length of rope needed to form the loop, in feet. Adding
1&nbsp;foot of space between the outside of the original circle and the
expanded circle will, by definition, increase the circle's radius by
1&nbsp;foot, to \( r + 1 \). The circumference of a circle is \( C = 2\pi r \),
and we can subtract the circumference of the smaller (original) circle from the
circumference of the larger one to get the difference in circumference, which
will be the amount of additional rope you'll need: \[ \begin{align*} C =\ & 2
\pi (r+1) - 2 \pi (r) \\ =\ & 2\pi r + 2\pi - 2\pi r \\ =\ & 2 \pi \\ \approx\
& 6.28 \\ \end{align*} \] So a little more than 6&nbsp;feet will do it.

.Now suppose you have a rope wrapped tightly around <em>the equator of the Earth</em>.
You want to loosen it so there's 1 foot of space between the rope and the
Earth. How much more rope will you use?

<p>
<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>

.Presumably the same approach will work, right? But if you try to run the
numbers, you might find yourself wondering, wait, where do we plug in the
current size of the rope?

.Well…you don't need to, no more than we needed to for the circle the size of
your arm. Incredibly, the answer is <em>still 6.28 feet</em>, for a rope the
length of the circumference of the entire Earth. The amount of rope needed
depends solely on the size of the additional gap; the size of the object being
wrapped is irrelevant!

.If you remember how radians work, one way to make this more intuitive is to
consider three concentric circles, with radii of 1, 2, and 3 feet respectively,
and an arc composing one-quarter of each circle. This quarter of the circle is
\( \pi / 2 \) radians, since a complete revolution is 360 degrees or \( 2\pi \)
radians. Now consider the length of this arc of each circle. The innermost
circle of radius 1 is the unit circle, where the angle in radians is exactly
equal to the length of the arc it subtends, so it's \( \pi / 2 \) feet long.
Now for the larger circles: radians are defined as the ratio of the arc length
to the circle's radius, and the ratio is held constant (because the angle /
radians we're considering is always one-quarter of each circle), so the arc
length is directly proportional to each circle's radius, and we can just
multiply the unit circle's arc length by the radius. All this to say, our three
arcs will be of length \( \pi / 2 \), \( \pi \), and \( 3\pi / 2 \)
feet.

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/earth-circles.png">

.It should be obvious that you can continue drawing concentric circles
1 foot apart <em>ad libitum</em> and this pattern will continue; the difference
between the arc length of two consecutive ones will always be \( \pi / 2 \)
feet. But then that means the total increase in circumference will always be 4
times that, or \( 2\pi \) feet, for each 1 foot of additional radius, whether
you're on the first circle or the <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=earth%27s+circumference+at+equator+in+feet">131
millionth</a> one.

    :shortdes: How-to: Punching holes for edge-notched cards
    :tags: Tech

.A couple of years ago I made a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8qHPXPnQps">video</a>
on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge-notched_card">edge-notched cards</a>,
a pre-computer form of database used by punching small holes along the rim of index cards
and notching some of them out to store binary data.
You can then put needles through the holes
to filter out the cards that have a particular bit in that spot.

.The video demos how they work, but doesn't give much if any information on creating your own.
I was meaning to, and still eventually do intend to, put out another video on that –
but in the meantime I've had a couple of people email me
asking my advice for punching cards to use with such a system,
since nobody manufactures the pre-punched cards anymore,
so I figured I might as well post the two-minute version for others here
since I've already written it.

.I use standard US 3×5 or 4×6 cards, but the size doesn't matter.
I use an ⅛-inch hand punch to initially make the holes, one by one,
and a vintage Royal McBee notching punch that I bought on eBay to notch out the holes.
If you can't find a notching punch,
a small pair of scissors works all right for notching,
it's just a bit annoying and any rough edges you leave risk getting the needle hung up;
to reduce hangups, the notch should be gently flared,
forming a “V” shape with the point towards the inside of the card.

.This method is rather labor-intensive, but it works fine,
and once you get into the rhythm it's actually not as unpleasant as you'd imagine
to punch hundreds of holes in index cards individually
(pick a day when you're in a good mood and put on some music).
I tried getting a heavy-duty hand punch,
but its design made it nearly impossible to see where I was punching,
so I actually use a pretty cheap one that I bought at Michaels some years ago instead;
I'm able to cleanly punch three cards at a time with that one.
There's probably a better option out there somewhere –
if you find a great punch that's available for purchase online, let me know!

.Someone once wrote to me and suggested trying a comb-binding or spiral-binding punch.
That sounds like a promising avenue, but I haven't tried it yet;
these are quite expensive and hard to find,
so you'd have to be quite committed to buy one new,
but maybe you could find one at surplus or use one at a copy shop.
I think the holes are squared off on a lot of those, rather than round,
but that would likely still work all right,
there's just slightly more risk of the needle getting hung up.

.I've also heard of people buying
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/C-Line-Spiral-Bound-Notebook-48909/dp/B0D63WJWW9">spiral-bound index cards</a>,
unbending and twisting out the spiral,
and using those holes.
I haven't tried this either, but I'd expect that to work pretty well;
the main limitations are that you get a very limited number of holes
since the punch is only on one edge
(from a quick look on Amazon,
 it appears there are usually 14–20 depending on the size and brand),
and the number and spacing of holes doesn't seem to be standardized,
so you might have some trouble finding more matching cards later if you need them.
This could be a great quick hack for some applications though!

.If you are punching your own holes,
the most important thing to know is that,
lacking any specialized manufacturing equipment,
if you want the holes to align,
you need to use a master template.
First punch the pattern of holes you want in one card
(I like to use a ruler to mark off the centers of where I want to punch,
 to help get them a little more even;
 but they don't have to be perfectly even to work well
 so long as they end up the same on every card).
Then punch the holes in the other cards <em>through</em> that card
(like, stack the blanks behind it,
 align and clip them tightly together with a binder clip,
 then place the punch head in the holes in the top and punch).

.The master wears out slowly
because you won't manage to punch perfectly in the center every time,
no matter what method you're using,
and you'll gradually sliver off little pieces of the edges of the template holes.
I find I can usually count on 50 cards or so before the holes start to get fuzzy.
So in practice,
I first punch a couple “child” template cards from the master,
and then do the rest of the punching from those,
creating new template cards from the master as necessary.
That will get you to 2,500 cleanly punched cards if each template lasts for 50 uses.
I suppose you could try doing a third level of templates,
but each propagation also creates a little inaccuracy,
so I don't think that's a good idea in most cases.

.One final tip: most commercial punched cards
had a bite cut out of one of the corners at a 45-degree angle
(usually the upper-right,
 presumably because this corner is easiest for right-handed people to manipulate).
This is to make it quick and easy to confirm that all the cards are right-side up,
and put them back in the same direction should you spill the stack.
You can easily replicate this with a pair of scissors,
and it definitely comes in handy occasionally.

    :attr: Why did we deactivate the longest kiss world record? (Guinness)
    :source: https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2023/7/why-did-we-deactivate-the-longest-kiss-world-record-754853
    :tags: Humor

Ekkachai and Laksana – who had set the [longest-kiss] record once before in 2011 – ultimately won the contest...however, soon after, we deactivated the record category. We did this because the competition had become too dangerous.
