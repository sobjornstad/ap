    :shortdes: Beating jet lag with Timeshifter
    :tags: Tech | Travel

.I'm pretty sensitive to circadian rhythm disruptions. After large time zone
changes, I'll sometimes continue getting tired early and having malaise for
days, and even daylight saving time throws me off. My last few RemNote offsites
have been particularly annoying, as they've all been held in the Eastern
Hemisphere where a majority of our team members live, so I cross six to twelve
time zones and am zonked out while others move only a couple and are fine the
next day.

.I was in Barcelona for the last couple weeks and used a clever app called <a
href="https://www.timeshifter.com">Timeshifter</a>, which builds a
jet-lag-reduction plan for you to follow for (usually) five days, starting two
days before your trip, with recommendations on light exposure, sleep times, and
caffeine and melatonin use. The app itself is simple and well-designed – you
just add your itinerary (dates and flight numbers) and it does everything else
for you, including sending you notifications when it's time to take some
action.

.Most of the recommendations are fairly easy to follow (e.g., shift your
sleep/wake times one hour each day for the two days prior to travel, or get
bright light in the morning or evening). Sometimes they can be seriously
annoying, though (e.g., on the way back, I had to avoid light as much as
possible until noon for our last two days, which meant I was sitting in the
completely dark kitchen of our AirBNB working on my MacBook with <a
href="https://justgetflux.com">f.lux</a> manually set to Minneapolis time). You
might have to wear sunglasses indoors occasionally (for what it's worth though,
I wore them in airports and on planes quite a few times this trip, and nobody
commented or looked at me funny; YMMV). The app says it has a “practicality
filter” which understands that, e.g., you probably can't sleep while you're at
an airport waiting to board your plane, even if that would be the ideal time,
and tweaks the instructions accordingly. I wish you could manually mark
specific pieces of advice as unfollowable in your situation and have it adjust
the schedule, but the plans do seem to be reasonably forgiving if you have to
cheat occasionally.

.Verdict? I experienced essentially zero jet lag this trip. I felt normally
tired within an hour of my destination time zone's bedtime on the first day in
both directions, and never once had any trouble sleeping. This felt
<em>bizarre</em>, though of course welcome! Despite the mild annoyance of
following the plan, I'll definitely be doing it again. (And actually, I think I
kind of appreciate having strict instructions to follow during long transits –
it adds structure to an otherwise irritatingly formless period of time.)

.I will say that preparing in advance of the trip makes me feel just slightly
worse than normal for an extra two days, which might be a slight downside. But
it's very mild – more like I can tell that something's off than that I actually
feel bad. When I've tried to shift a couple hours in advance by myself in the
past, I've felt much worse for those days; the light exposure seems to be doing
a lot to keep this feeling OK. Still, if it's ever important that you're at
100% right before leaving and how you feel after arriving is relatively
unimportant, that might be a reason not to use the app for that trip, or to
skip setting up your plan until the day you depart.

.I should also note that I used the app for a trip once last year as well and,
while it still clearly helped, it wasn't quite so miraculous. However, that was
a 12-hour shift compared to a 6-hour shift – I wouldn't expect zero jet lag on
a 12-hour shift no matter what, that's just too much! I also didn't learn about
the app until just before I left, so I was unable to do the full 2 days of
pre-adaptation, which I think is quite important to its success. I'll
definitely update this next time I do a huge shift.

.Sometimes the recommendations are so bizarre you'll be tempted not to follow
them. For instance, on my return trip west, I got up at 7am and it told me to
sleep at 11am/4am on the way from Barcelona to Amsterdam (understandable
because I'd only slept 5 hours overnight and it was still dark in Minneapolis).
Then it told me to take melatonin and sleep for five hours on the transatlantic
flight at 3pm/8am (?!), which is not only a bizarre time to sleep in either
time zone, but completely contrary to the conventional wisdom that you should
avoid sleeping until a normal destination bedtime when going west. But I
figured I'd trust the process and give it a try, and it absolutely worked, even
though I had to wake up an hour and a half in for the in-flight meal and then
go to sleep again. I think it was somehow able to work out that sleeping at
this time wouldn't disrupt my adaptation but would still prevent me from
getting tired early after landing. That's the kind of thing the scientific
understanding must include somewhere, but is way too complicated to give as
advice unless it's embedded in a particular schedule.

<div class="callout">

.Several people I've talked to about the app have thought it wouldn't work for
them because they can't sleep on airplanes. So to be clear, when I say I
“sleep” on the plane, I mean I recline my seat one notch, put on
noise-canceling headphones, wrap myself in my <a
href="https://mosmu.se/#TravelBlanket">travel blanket</a>, close my eyes, and
sit still. I'll usually doze and drift a little, but I'm lucky to get more than
an hour of uninterrupted sleep at a time, if that. If I find myself getting
really bored and unable to drift at all, I'll read on my Kindle at minimum
brightness without turning on any of the lights until I start to feel a little
sleepier, which usually takes me half an hour or so, and then go back to
“sleeping”. You certainly don't need to be able to actually sleep well on a
plane for this to work. Even if you get literally no sleep, just sitting still
in the dark not doing anything will help your body adjust.

.Several people I've talked to have also been turned off by the price
($10 per trip or $25 for unlimited trips for a year). All I can say is, if
after spending thousands of dollars on a trip, getting rid of jet lag isn't
worth $10 to you, I'm jealous of how mild your jet lag must be!

    :shortdes: Design Hall of Shame: GE Cync light switches
    :tags: Design

.I use GE Cync smart lightbulbs and lamp sockets in parts of my apartment so
that I can (a) bring the lights up slowly in the morning in my bedroom, and (b)
switch on and off the 8 lamps in my living room at the same time. Overall, the
system works pretty well for something that's so hilariously complex for
controlling lights (when I connected my first devices and was prompted to
<em>update my lightbulb's firmware</em>, I knew I had entered a brave new world).

.The switches you use with them are subtly awful, though:

<img class="center" width="400px" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/bad-design-cync-switch.jpg">

.The two buttons at the bottom allow you to cycle through different color
temperatures, if your light source supports them. That mostly works fine (it's
kind of silly that it cycles through only a hard-coded set of temperatures,
given that using the phone app you can create millions of different colors, but
that isn't really the hardware's fault; the left/right selector is a perfectly
fine choice).

.Then the top. The top- and bottom-most buttons adjust the brightness. The
middle buttons are “on” and “off”. What's the problem with that? Well, first of
all, buttons are a horrendous choice for adjusting the brightness of a light
source. There are 20 gradations, so if you want to go from max brightness to
min brightness, you have to press the “down” button nineteen times, or stand
there holding it down while whistling to yourself. A dial would be much, much
better.

.But what catapults this from someone cost-cutting too aggressively to a Design
Hall of Shame nomination is that it's almost impossible to reliably press the
correct button without looking at the switch…which, uh, when you consider how
light switches are typically used, is a pretty big problem! At least 25% of the
time I either push the “on” button when I meant to push the “off” button or
vice versa, or press the “brighter” button when I meant the “on” button or the
“dimmer” button when I meant the “off” button. It's certainly possible to find
the correct button by feel, but you have to run your fingers over the entire
light switch from top to bottom first, because the middles of each button feel
almost identical. The raised centerline in the middle of the “on/off” position
seems like it would help, but it's difficult to distinguish from the lip
between the on/off and dimmer sections unless you're really paying close
attention (and who's ever paying close attention to flipping a light switch?).
The engraved arrows also seem like they would help, but they're almost
imperceptible unless you're actually moving your finger over it; when you
blindly land your finger on the switch and feel a button under it, you
generally are not moving your finger enough to notice.

.I think the ideal design here would be a raised infinite-spin
volume-knob-style control plus the color temperature buttons. You would turn
the control to change the brightness, push it in to toggle between on and off,
and also be able to nudge it up or down to explicitly select “on” or “off”.
That last interaction has several motivations:

<ul>

    <li>In the very common case of reaching around the edge of a doorway to the
    light switch when entering or exiting a room, it's much easier to flick
    your hand parallel to the wall than to push <em>back into</em> the
    wall.</li>

    <li>Everyone's already used to the “flick up/down” motion. If you do it by
    mistake on the wrong kind of switch, it just does what you mean.</li>

    <li>The reason these have separate “off” and “on” buttons, rather than just
    a single toggle, is that it's possible for the switch to control many
    lights at once and for some of them to be off and some of them to be on. So
    if you have separate buttons, you can select the new state you want for the
    whole group in a single action. It's nice to maintain this capability.</li>

</ul>

.If the nudge is too expensive to get right, though, or it proves too hard to
add enough friction to not randomly spin the dimmer by mistake, a knob with
just a push-in design would still be vastly better than the current one. You'd
just make it turn all the lights off in the partially-on state, then back on
the second time you pushed it. (I think off first is better even though this is
the opposite of the typical design for partial states like this, because if
it's late at night and you have most of the lights off or dimmed, you want to
be able to shut everything off without making the room blindingly bright.
Having the lights momentarily flicker off before they all come on, when your
finger is already on the switch, is much less annoying. Another option would be
to have a timeout of a quarter second or so before the lights changed state,
during which you could double-tap to select the other action immediately.)

.Even if they didn't add a dial, a <em>tiny</em> bit more attention to tactile
feedback could have made the current design a great deal better. Just a simple
raised dot on either the on/off buttons or the dim buttons would be a huge
usability improvement. Maybe one dot on “off” and three dots on “on” (rather
like <a
href="https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/8480782/bathroom_button_dual_flush_toilet_icon">the
icons on dual-flush toilets</a>, which I've always felt are a brilliant piece
of design in that even if you've never seen a dual-flush toilet before, you can
easily figure out what the buttons do), or a circle on “off” and a sunburst on
“on”.

.Failing even that, the software could make a useful contribution by not
distinguishing between the “off” and “on” buttons if the entire group was
currently off or on already. If the entire room is dark and I push the “off”
button, it should be obvious that I intended to turn the lights on rather than
more-off.

    :shortdes: Boring investment advice
    :tags: Finance | Life

.A few of my friends have been asking me for advice on getting started investing lately,
so I thought I'd write it up instead of explaining it over and over again.

.There are two ways you can get rich through investments:

<ol>
<li>
    Spend a lot of time looking for opportunities to outperform.
    Be unusually good at that.
    Lose money on a lot of bad investments,
    and make a killing on a couple good ones that make up for the losses and then some.
    This might happen in 1&nbsp;year or 100&nbsp;years.
</li>
<li>
    Don't think about it at all.
    Put as much money as you can afford to in some funds that track the economy as a whole
    (or some large sector of it; we call these “index funds”).
    Keep doing that for 30&nbsp;years.
</li>
</ol>

.If you're the kind of person who's really well suited to do #1, OK, go for it.
If you're asking me for advice, though, you are almost certainly better suited for #2,
so give up the idea of #1 right now –
it's probably intimidating you into not getting started.

.The economy as a whole isn't a perfectly safe bet, of course,
but it's probably more likely to stay on a decently positive trajectory than any other thing you could pick.
You're also very unlikely to ever curse your stupidity for investing in it,
which cannot be said for most other choices.
You won't ever do as well as you possibly could with this approach,
but the average case is much, much better, and it earns more than enough to satisfy most people.
You only get one life – go for a solid average, not a super-high-variance approach.

<div class="callout">

If you actually like the idea of #1,
set aside 10% of the money you want to invest for that approach
and treat it like you're bringing money to Vegas:
if you win, sweet,
and if you lose, no big deal,
you only put aside the money you could afford to lose,
and you can write it off as the cost of entertainment.

</div>


.A couple principles for implementing #2:

.<strong>Time in the market beats everything else.</strong>
On average, if you invest $100 a month from age 25 to 35 into something reliable and then never save another penny and just let it ride,
you end up with more money at age 65 than if you invest $100 a month from age 35 to 65!
This sucks because that's also the time most people are least able to put aside money,
but unfortunately it's hard to argue math into being fairer (let me know if you find a way).
If you have a steady income, figure out how much you can afford to throw in and set up a monthly or biweekly automatic withdrawal so you never even have to think about it.
<a href="https://mosmu.se/#PowerOfKonsistency">Getting started and being consistent beat volume.</a>

.<strong>Don't change your course depending on how your investments are doing.</strong>
This approach does not require you to follow the news or switch from idea to idea all the time –
so if you don't trust yourself not to change course,
don't even look at how you're doing.
(Probably once a year or so you should double-check
 that you're still periodically saving the amount you thought you were
 in the investments you thought you were.
 Otherwise, no need.)
Losses aren't real until you withdraw the money or switch it to a different investment;
that's when you lock in your loss.
And if your bet on the economy was ever good in the long run, it's still good during a temporary downturn.
So just wait; there's a good chance the number will be back up again by the time you need the money.

.<strong>You are not going to be smart enough to time the market</strong> and make extra money.
Even people who get paid six figures to do this full-time usually aren't!
So just keep throwing in money regularly whether the market is up or down.
Sometimes you'll invest on a day where the market drops precipitously after you invest, and you could have done better.
But sometimes you'll invest on a day where the market just took a huge dip, and you make a bunch of extra money when it goes back up the next day.
When you split your investing into a dozen or two purchases every year, it evens out in the long run.
Similarly, don't hold back money that you would be investing for a later date when it “looks like a good time to invest.”
Yes, sometimes you could outperform this way,
but people have simulated this scenario and found that your average gain is highest when you just dump the money immediately
(even if it's a windfall of a couple hundred thousand dollars and this feels much riskier),
because on average the market goes up,
and you're more likely to miss out on easy gains than anything else.
(Plus, remember that time in the market beats everything else?
 You're losing time in the market.)

.And a few boring mechanics:

.Most people in the United States should start with a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> account.
You can put up to $7,000 a year in one.
(There are <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/smart-money/roth-ira-income-limits">income eligibility limits</a>;
 if you make more than $150,000 a year, you should go check on these first.)
You can't easily withdraw Roth IRA gains until you reach retirement age,
but you never have to pay any tax on the gains,
which makes your money go at least 15% further.
And you can withdraw whatever you put in tax- and penalty-free at any time,
so if you don't have much money to invest you could
put some general-purpose savings in a Roth IRA.
Hopefully you won't need the money back and you can keep it invested,
but if you do you can yank it again and you'll still get to keep any gains tax-free.
(Ideally, of course, you would both save some short-term money and make some long-term investments.
 But getting started as soon as possible is the most important thing!)

.The exception to this is if your employer offers a retirement plan with matching funds,
where you put in some amount of money and they add some of their own.
This is basically free money,
so if you have access to such a plan and you're not contributing enough to get the full match,
you should do that first.

<div class="callout">

.Sometimes people wonder if they shouldn't put some of their money into a non-retirement account first,
because they don't want to wait until retirement age to have more money.
I think the answer is usually no.
If you're going to need the money in the next couple of years,
you probably shouldn't be investing it anyway;
if the market drops, you won't have enough time to make it back.
(You could put it in a high-interest savings account, or maybe a CD or government bonds.)
If you're thinking more along the lines of having lots of money in a decade or two,
I think it usually comes out better to go really hard on your retirement accounts first.
Your income is probably going to go up in the intervening years
unless you have plans to make a big career change,
so you might not need investment money then at all,
and meanwhile you'll be giving your retirement money time to grow tax-free.
If you get too far ahead,
you can just stop adding money to your retirement accounts
and spend that money on something else.

.(If you end up with enough money that you can retire very early,
there are also some ways
to get money out of your US retirement accounts early without paying a penalty;
you can worry about that if you end up needing it.)

.It's also worth noting that non-retirement investment accounts
have a bunch of complicated tax considerations,
which will make getting started much more annoying.

.As always, I'm sure you could come up with some scenario
where using the retirement account first isn't the right choice,
but unless you have an obvious one,
you probably shouldn't worry about this.
</div>

.As for <strong>what company to open your investment accounts with</strong>
– you won't go wrong with
either <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com">Vanguard</a>
or <a href="https://www.fidelity.com">Fidelity</a>.
Vanguard has been in the business for much longer (they basically invented index funds)
and is shareholder-owned, which is pretty cool.
Fidelity offers a bunch of other financial products as well,
so you might be able to consolidate a bunch of your accounts there if you like that idea,
and most people think their website is a little easier to use.

.<strong>What funds, specifically, to invest in?</strong>
You can make this topic pretty much as complex as you want.
But if you're just starting out, I'd suggest a target date fund.
You pick a year close to when you expect to retire
(for instance, if you're 30 years old today and you expect to retire around age 65,
 you might pick a 2060 fund),
and the fund managers will distribute your money over their other index funds
based on how far you are from that target date
(you want to invest in safer things
 when there's a shorter time horizon
 because there's less time to recover from losses,
 but riskier things
 when there's a sufficiently long one
 because you'll earn more money on average).
You pick the fund once and you're done (except for continuing to add money).

.You can likely do marginally better if you know what you're doing,
but again, if you're asking me for investment advice because you're clueless,
you should start out as simple as possible,
and if you get curious and want to nerd out, you can start adding complexity later.
Someone who consistently uses a target date fund will <em>vastly</em> outperform the average person already,
and someone who dives into the details will usually do only very slightly better.

.Make sure the target date fund is low-fee;
not much work goes into managing one,
so they shouldn't be taking more than ~0.10% of your money.
All the Vanguard and Fidelity ones are fine.

    :shortdes: What about the climate impact of Bitcoin mining?
    :tags: Society | Tech

.Seeing how silly the <a href="#post-223">ChatGPT energy usage claim</a> was, I
remembered that I've been shocked in the past by how energy-intensive Bitcoin
mining is, so I figured I'd better double-check that one. Using numbers from
the other Substack post, plus the links provided:

<ul>
    <li>Total energy use of the Internet: ~800 TWh per year</li>
    <li>Total energy use of Bitcoin mining: ~<a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption">175 TWh per year</a></li>
    <li>Total energy use of ChatGPT, if we replaced every Google search with a ChatGPT query (way more than actual usage): 2.2 TWh per year</li>
</ul>

.So Bitcoin mining uses 80 times as much energy as this overestimate of ChatGPT
usage.

.If it taught us nothing else, though, the ChatGPT claim hopefully reminded us
of the danger of not understanding the scale of our base values, so how much
energy is the Internet using?

.Total global energy use <a
href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-consumption">is about
180,000 TWh per year</a>, so the Internet is responsible for about 0.45% of
total global energy consumption. If you apportion the energy consumption of the
Internet equally to each of its ~5 billion users, that comes to about 160 KWh
per person per year, equivalent to about 3 weeks of running a space heater on
medium during office hours, or driving a moderately efficient electric car
about 480 miles.

.The energy use of Bitcoin mining is about one-quarter that of the Internet, so
it's around 1/1000th of global energy usage, or like each Internet user driving
120 extra miles each year. Given that the existence of Bitcoin doesn't seem to
have had huge positive effects on the world overall, I think there's a case for
considering Bitcoin a poor use of energy, but it also doesn't seem wildly
alarming yet. And it's about in line with the level of “energy waster” I had
given it in my head.

<div class="callout">

.Is 160 KWh per year a surprisingly large amount of energy for your Internet
use? It surprised me, at any rate; virtual things seldom feel like they would
have much real-world environmental impact. And I bet most people reading this
should peg their Internet energy usage as quite a lot more than the average
user. There's a big difference in energy consumption between an “Internet User”
in the developing world who reads Facebook for an hour a day on their phone and
a professional who uses a full-size laptop or even a high-powered desktop
computer to access the Internet for 12 hours a day for work and leisure.

.That said, compared to the impact of what you might be doing if you weren't
using the Internet – say, going to the store and buying a physical book, or
flying to another city for a meeting – it's likely a good trade.

    :shortdes: Claims about AI's impact on climate are misleading and distracting
    :tags: AI | Society | Tech

.Claims that ChatGPT or other LLM or AI tools use a ridiculous amount of energy
and/or water have been making the rounds recently. They are very misleading.

.It's true that ChatGPT uses an eye-popping amount of energy when
compared to the amount of energy you use in your everyday life. For instance,
you may have seen headlines that ChatGPT “uses as much energy as 20,000
households.” But that's kind of like remarking that New York City uses a
ridiculous amount of energy compared to you – <em>obviously</em> it does,
because there are millions of people in New York and only one of you. Millions
of people use ChatGPT, so yeah, the aggregated energy usage is going to be
high. But if we compare it to something that operates on a similar scale, it
looks totally normal, or even outright good; for instance, Netflix uses
hundreds of times as much energy as ChatGPT!

.To be clear, I think there are many good reasons to be wary of AI. Even if all
progress in AI stopped tomorrow (which is obviously not going to happen),
society would still change quite a lot just with the new tech that we've
already got and haven't figured out how to use well yet. And it's quite
possible that the next couple generations of LLMs will start putting relatively
high-skilled people out of jobs, or just leading people to question their own
value when they're no longer better than a computer at most or all of their
skills. This is not even to mention the very real possibility that further AI
development will cause major catastrophes or even permanently usurp humanity as
the primary controller of our planet.

.But it's precisely because these reasons for skepticism exist that I have no
patience at all for the climate angle. If the real problem is that we might
want to attempt restrictions on AI development or change the way we approach AI
because it might fundamentally change society and our relationship to the world
in a way that humanity collectively does not want, can we talk about
<em>that</em> instead of trying to convince people that ChatGPT uses too much
electricity? People have a limited amount of energy to attend to moral or
practical objections to everyday things; we shouldn't waste it on silly ones.
Frankly, even if ChatGPT did use a crazy amount of electricity, that wouldn't
be the best angle to approach the question from given the comparative stakes,
but given that it doesn't, spending any time at all on it is disingenuous and
dangerous.

.Andy Masley has an <a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/p/individual-ai-use-is-not-bad-for">
extremely thorough debunking
</a>
of the claim on his Substack, but if you don't have half an hour for that,
here are a few choice comparisons:

<img class="center" width="640" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/andymasley.png">

(In the graph, the activities that don't show a time or number of uses represent 1 year of that activity.)

<blockquote>
If OpenAI didn't train GPT-4, that would be about the same as there being no flights between New York [and] San Francisco for about 2 days. That's not 2 days per week. It's 2 days total. Even if ChatGPT had to be retrained every year (and remember, it doesn't) that is less than 1% of the emissions from flights between these two specific American cities. How much of our collective effort is it worth to stop this?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Video streaming is using 1,600 times as much energy as ChatGPT, but we don’t hear about it as much because it’s a much more normal part of everyday life. 20,000 households can sound like a crazy number when you compare it to your individual life, but it’s incredibly small by the standards of internet energy use.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
If we assume every...American uses a digital clock, then American digital clocks are using at minimum 1,100 Olympic swimming pools of water each year. That’s a shocking statistic if we don’t contextualize it with how much water is used in our energy system in general. The American energy sector as a whole uses 200 trillion liters of water each year, enough for [80,000,000] Olympic swimming pools. ChatGPT is using 1,500 Olympic swimming pools of water (with the water used for energy included), or 0.002% of America’s total water used for energy.

    :shortdes: Rope around the Earth
    :tags: Brainteaser | Math

.Here's a simple math problem that messes with your intuition. Suppose you have
some rope, and a loop of it is wrapped snugly once around your arm. Now you
want to feed more rope into the loop so that it encircles your arm with
1&nbsp;foot of space between the rope and your arm. How much more rope will you
need?

.Well, when the rope is wrapped tightly around your arm, it forms a circle
(roughly, anyway) with some radius of \( r \) feet (probably fractional unless
you have extremely thick arms). The circumference of this circle \( C \) then
represents the length of rope needed to form the loop, in feet. Adding
1&nbsp;foot of space between the outside of the original circle and the
expanded circle will, by definition, increase the circle's radius by
1&nbsp;foot, to \( r + 1 \). The circumference of a circle is \( C = 2\pi r \),
and we can subtract the circumference of the smaller (original) circle from the
circumference of the larger one to get the difference in circumference, which
will be the amount of additional rope you'll need: \[ \begin{align*} C =\ & 2
\pi (r+1) - 2 \pi (r) \\ =\ & 2\pi r + 2\pi - 2\pi r \\ =\ & 2 \pi \\ \approx\
& 6.28 \\ \end{align*} \] So a little more than 6&nbsp;feet will do it.

.Now suppose you have a rope wrapped tightly around <em>the equator of the Earth</em>.
You want to loosen it so there's 1 foot of space between the rope and the
Earth. How much more rope will you use?

<p>
<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>

.Presumably the same approach will work, right? But if you try to run the
numbers, you might find yourself wondering, wait, where do we plug in the
current size of the rope?

.Well…you don't need to, no more than we needed to for the circle the size of
your arm. Incredibly, the answer is <em>still 6.28 feet</em>, for a rope the
length of the circumference of the entire Earth. The amount of rope needed
depends solely on the size of the additional gap; the size of the object being
wrapped is irrelevant!

.If you remember how radians work, one way to make this more intuitive is to
consider three concentric circles, with radii of 1, 2, and 3 feet respectively,
and an arc composing one-quarter of each circle. This quarter of the circle is
\( \pi / 2 \) radians, since a complete revolution is 360 degrees or \( 2\pi \)
radians. Now consider the length of this arc of each circle. The innermost
circle of radius 1 is the unit circle, where the angle in radians is exactly
equal to the length of the arc it subtends, so it's \( \pi / 2 \) feet long.
Now for the larger circles: radians are defined as the ratio of the arc length
to the circle's radius, and the ratio is held constant (because the angle /
radians we're considering is always one-quarter of each circle), so the arc
length is directly proportional to each circle's radius, and we can just
multiply the unit circle's arc length by the radius. All this to say, our three
arcs will be of length \( \pi / 2 \), \( \pi \), and \( 3\pi / 2 \)
feet.

<img class="center" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/earth-circles.png">

.It should be obvious that you can continue drawing concentric circles
1 foot apart <em>ad libitum</em> and this pattern will continue; the difference
between the arc length of two consecutive ones will always be \( \pi / 2 \)
feet. But then that means the total increase in circumference will always be 4
times that, or \( 2\pi \) feet, for each 1 foot of additional radius, whether
you're on the first circle or the <a

    :shortdes: How-to: Punching holes for edge-notched cards
    :tags: Tech

.A couple of years ago I made a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8qHPXPnQps">video</a>
on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge-notched_card">edge-notched cards</a>,
a pre-computer form of database used by punching small holes along the rim of index cards
and notching some of them out to store binary data.
You can then put needles through the holes
to filter out the cards that have a particular bit in that spot.

.The video demos how they work, but doesn't give much if any information on creating your own.
I was meaning to, and still eventually do intend to, put out another video on that –
but in the meantime I've had a couple of people email me
asking my advice for punching cards to use with such a system,
since nobody manufactures the pre-punched cards anymore,
so I figured I might as well post the two-minute version for others here
since I've already written it.

.I use standard US 3×5 or 4×6 cards, but the size doesn't matter.
I use an ⅛-inch hand punch to initially make the holes, one by one,
and a vintage Royal McBee notching punch that I bought on eBay to notch out the holes.
If you can't find a notching punch,
a small pair of scissors works all right for notching,
it's just a bit annoying and any rough edges you leave risk getting the needle hung up;
to reduce hangups, the notch should be gently flared,
forming a “V” shape with the point towards the inside of the card.

.This method is rather labor-intensive, but it works fine,
and once you get into the rhythm it's actually not as unpleasant as you'd imagine
to punch hundreds of holes in index cards individually
(pick a day when you're in a good mood and put on some music).
I tried getting a heavy-duty hand punch,
but its design made it nearly impossible to see where I was punching,
so I actually use a pretty cheap one that I bought at Michaels some years ago instead;
I'm able to cleanly punch three cards at a time with that one.
There's probably a better option out there somewhere –
if you find a great punch that's available for purchase online, let me know!

.Someone once wrote to me and suggested trying a comb-binding or spiral-binding punch.
That sounds like a promising avenue, but I haven't tried it yet;
these are quite expensive and hard to find,
so you'd have to be quite committed to buy one new,
but maybe you could find one at surplus or use one at a copy shop.
I think the holes are squared off on a lot of those, rather than round,
but that would likely still work all right,
there's just slightly more risk of the needle getting hung up.

.I've also heard of people buying
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/C-Line-Spiral-Bound-Notebook-48909/dp/B0D63WJWW9">spiral-bound index cards</a>,
unbending and twisting out the spiral,
and using those holes.
I haven't tried this either, but I'd expect that to work pretty well;
the main limitations are that you get a very limited number of holes
since the punch is only on one edge
(from a quick look on Amazon,
 it appears there are usually 14–20 depending on the size and brand),
and the number and spacing of holes doesn't seem to be standardized,
so you might have some trouble finding more matching cards later if you need them.
This could be a great quick hack for some applications though!

.If you are punching your own holes,
the most important thing to know is that,
lacking any specialized manufacturing equipment,
if you want the holes to align,
you need to use a master template.
First punch the pattern of holes you want in one card
(I like to use a ruler to mark off the centers of where I want to punch,
 to help get them a little more even;
 but they don't have to be perfectly even to work well
 so long as they end up the same on every card).
Then punch the holes in the other cards <em>through</em> that card
(like, stack the blanks behind it,
 align and clip them tightly together with a binder clip,
 then place the punch head in the holes in the top and punch).

.The master wears out slowly
because you won't manage to punch perfectly in the center every time,
no matter what method you're using,
and you'll gradually sliver off little pieces of the edges of the template holes.
I find I can usually count on 50 cards or so before the holes start to get fuzzy.
So in practice,
I first punch a couple “child” template cards from the master,
and then do the rest of the punching from those,
creating new template cards from the master as necessary.
That will get you to 2,500 cleanly punched cards if each template lasts for 50 uses.
I suppose you could try doing a third level of templates,
but each propagation also creates a little inaccuracy,
so I don't think that's a good idea in most cases.

.One final tip: most commercial punched cards
had a bite cut out of one of the corners at a 45-degree angle
(usually the upper-right,
 presumably because this corner is easiest for right-handed people to manipulate).
This is to make it quick and easy to confirm that all the cards are right-side up,
and put them back in the same direction should you spill the stack.
You can easily replicate this with a pair of scissors,
and it definitely comes in handy occasionally.

.A friend of mine was telling me about the <a

the other night and making up some examples of interesting people who
participate. One of them was <em>Muslim imams</em>, which my brain decided to
parse as “Muslimy moms.”

.Nothing against imams, but despite its implausibility, I find my version
infinitely more entertaining!

.I <a href="#post-83">previously complained about</a> the cost of Plan B
(1.5mg levonorgestrel, aka the most common version of the “morning-after pill”),
which runs in the neighborhood of $50 per dose for the brand-name version.
At the time, I noted that generics were barely any cheaper.

.For whatever reason,
it appears that you can now buy generic versions for under $10 on Amazon.
This actually seems like a reasonable margin!
No idea what changed.

Ekkachai and Laksana – who had set the [longest-kiss] record once before in 2011 – ultimately won the contest...however, soon after, we deactivated the record category. We did this because the competition had become too dangerous.
