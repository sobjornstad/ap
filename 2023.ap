    :tags: Research | Tech

.<a href="https://metaphor.systems">Metaphor</a> is an experimental new kind of
search engine based on an LLM. Rather than typing in keywords describing what
you're looking for, you pretend you already have the link you want and are
sending it to a friend, and write a brief introduction explaining what it is.
Then it supplies a list of predictions for what link you might be talking about.

.This works surprisingly well. I find it especially useful if I am thinking of an
article I know exists somewhere on the web, but can't remember what it was
called; it's challenging to find effective keywords for a traditional search
engine in this case, but usually easy to describe the article in enough detail
that Metaphor can find it.

.Metaphor is currently free and open to the public.
Give it a try:

    :shortdes: What the heck is TiddlyWiki, actually?
    :tags: Learning | Tech

.The other day I was on a first date
    and we were talking about our experiences of the early COVID-19 pandemic,
    and I mentioned that I had used much of my excessive free time to write
    a textbook called <a href="https://groktiddlywiki.com">Grok TiddlyWiki</a>.
Naturally, she asked what TiddlyWiki was,
    and I realized, somewhat to my alarm, that I had no effective way to explain it.
If anyone in the entire world
    should be able to give a good elevator pitch for TiddlyWiki,
    surely it ought to be me,
    seeing as I recently spent a year and a half writing a book to teach people how to use it!
My first reach was “<a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a>, but more customizable,”
    but she hadn't heard of Notion,
    so that didn't help at all,
    and this seems like a cop-out anyway;
    it just moves the question to, what the heck is Notion, actually?

.Once you get over the immediate absurdity of the fact that
    I just wrote a book about this tool and I still can't concisely explain what it is,
    that this is challenging isn't actually all that surprising:
    a general problem with researching, developing, and promoting
    tools for thought like TiddlyWiki
    is that they
    <a href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#ToolsForThinkingDontWow">don't wow</a>.
That is, because the really revolutionary ones allow you to think in new ways,
    the problem of understanding why the tool is useful
    and the problem of learning the tool
    are necessarily intertwined;
    without the habits of thought developed by learning and using the tool,
    the tool in some way <em>can't</em> make sense.
(Paul Graham popularized this line of thought back in 2001
 when he wrote about <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">Blub programmers</a>.)

.This said, surely I can at least do better than “Notion, but more customizable.”
A good start is the front page of <em>Grok</em> itself:

<blockquote>
TiddlyWiki is a human-shaped tool for organizing information and taking notes. It stores and relates information in a non-linear but structured way, just like your brain, and it doesn't forget things.
</blockquote>

.It's helpful to add some use cases, like I do a bit lower down:

<blockquote>
People use TiddlyWiki for keeping notes at their jobs, collecting their ideas, keeping track of what they read, drafting books, building static websites, storing recipes, managing genealogical databases, planning tabletop role-playing campaigns, and much more.
</blockquote>

.The big problem here is that, reading this description,
    you still don't know anything
    about <em>how</em> one uses TiddlyWiki to do this.
This is not really a problem for <em>Grok TiddlyWiki</em>,
    since the entire rest of the book is about this,
    but it's a big problem if you're trying to educate and/or hook
    people who aren't already interested.
It's like we've explained what a car is
    but not talked about how one uses the steering wheel
    and pedals to make it move around.
If you've never heard of a car or seen someone drive one,
    it's going to be tough to imagine someone using one without those details,
    and I find it's difficult to understand the value or purpose of software
    if you can't imagine the experience of using it.

.Here's my best shot at a version that incorporates most of the ideas above.
It starts by comparing to a tool almost everyone will know,
    but doesn't rely on that comparison;
    it incorporates the “human-shaped” idea
    and the example use cases,
    and it tries to give a picture of the actions one takes
    when working with a TiddlyWiki.
Its biggest weakness is that it tends on the formal and dense side.
I feel like I should be spending many more days on this problem;
    it's hard to imagine how the field of tools for thought in general
    is going to succeed unless we find a way to explain why it's important!

<hr>

.<strong>TiddlyWiki</strong> is a tool that helps you think in new ways
    by extending the fundamental ideas of the spreadsheet
    so that they work effectively with long-form prose.
Information in TiddlyWiki has a flexible structure,
    so you can match the shape of your content within the wiki
    to the way you think about it.
Things can be organized strictly,
    in tables like a spreadsheet
        or in hierarchies like an outline,
    or loosely, in webs of related components with nebulous relationships,
    and you can show the same data in different formats at different times.
You split your facts and ideas into little pieces called <em>tiddlers</em>
    (much like rows of a spreadsheet)
    and the tiddlers into fields (much like columns),
    then add links and tags to describe the relationships between tiddlers.
Then you can use custom formulas and formatting options
    to search, filter, sort,
        answer questions about the relationships between things,
        and change the appearance of your wiki to look like almost anything at all.

.The amount of flexibility TiddlyWiki affords makes it challenging to learn or even explain
    – you have to develop a few new ways of thinking to make effective use of the tool –
    so that's what my book is designed to help with.
I use my primary TiddlyWiki as a sort of topically organized journal,
    keeping track of things I've learned about myself, my life, and the world
    in a form where I can easily build on previous insights.

.I tried to go for a walk on the beach today. I did not think to check the wind
speed, which turned out to be 30mph gusting to 55mph. The Pacific was looking
pretty majestic, but I basically got low-pressure sandblasted as I walked
along. I also planned to take a shortcut through what looked on Google Maps
like a public park but turned out to be a heavily fenced private golf course,
and ended up having to walk along the median of a four-lane highway and then
vault over a jersey barrier to get to the beach (there wasn't too much traffic
and it felt pretty safe, but it wasn't exactly pleasant!).

.You know it's windy when your <s>windsock</s>ponytail sits at the side of your
head pointing forward:

    :shortdes: The Harrow and the Harvest
    :tags: Music

.Now in San Francisco for the month, this weekend I rented a car and did a road
trip north on Highway 1 to Fort Bragg, a beautiful drive. I brought with me and
listened to (multiple times) all the albums of Gillian Welch, who I recently
rediscovered. As funny as it sounds to say this since this was only five years
ago, I think I wasn't old enough to appreciate it when I heard it for the first
time, just after graduating college.

.(Although most of the music they make together is under the name “Gillian
Welch”, Welch's partner David Rawlings is as essential a part of it as she is;
they write the songs together and he plays lead guitar and sings harmony on
everything.)

.What I love about Welch and Rawlings &ndash; and the reason I think I wasn't
old enough to get it before &ndash; is that they tell the story of life just
like it is. They neither sugarcoat things nor tell unmitigated tragedies; their
songs are almost universally about suffering and loss and struggle, often
severe, and yet somewhere there's always a tinge of solace and redemption,
often so subtle and implied that you can't figure out where it comes from, but
you feel it, a testament to the fact that despite all this, people manage to
make life not just tolerable but very worth living. There are certainly no
promises, but there is hope.

.In recent years their arrangements have been sparse, usually just their voices
and two guitars, occasionally a little mandolin or banjo or percussion; it
sounds like two people sitting on their porch picking, except they're insanely
good. Musicians will know these simple arrangements are not the easiest but the
hardest to get right, because there's nowhere to hide the mistakes. But the two
of them are so perfectly in sync that there aren't any mistakes to hide. Their
voices even blend so well that sometimes I don't immediately notice Rawlings
has come in, even though he's singing different notes!

.I think their finest work so far is <em><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37u3_659fXk&list=PLnfP0ZfzDtH94lj2KojYlEe5mAKk6qCNo">The
Harrow and the Harvest</a></em>, published in 2011. The epitome of everything
I've said above is the track <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k35haKwqY14&list=PLnfP0ZfzDtH94lj2KojYlEe5mAKk6qCNo&index=6">“Hard
Times”</a>, which borrows the title from Stephen Foster but takes the sentiment
in a totally different direction. Instead of being comfortable and sparing a
thought for those worse off than them, the characters are in the thick of it,
dealing with the hard times, and they don't presume to ask for hard times to
“come again no more,” but simply promise themselves that the hard times “won't rule
their minds no more.” Yet the ploughman, very relatably, fails to take his own
advice, falling victim to modernization and ceasing his refrain, even as the
audience is exhorted to celebrate in the midst of it one more time.

.In <a href="#post-11">#11</a>, I was searching for terminology related to:

    incapable of, scared of, or strongly dislikes a necessary component or step of
    that goal/process/activity A&prime;, creating an infuriating tension and an
    obstacle to progress.
</blockquote>

.While I still don't have a clean word I like for it (but thanks to those who
have sent suggestions and interesting notes!), I noticed that David Cain has
the following enlightening diagram describing more or less this phenomenon in
his “<a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2015/04/freedom-comes-from-how-you-live/">How

.<em>Situation</em> (based on a true story): Three friends, Alice, Bob, and
Charlie, are planning on meeting up, but there is heavy snow. Alice writes to
say she can't make it because her street hasn't been plowed yet and her car
doesn't have enough clearance to drive through the snow. Bob and Charlie thus
learn the roads are probably going to be a real pain to venture out on, and
Alice can't make it, so they start to consider canceling, but aren't sure. Bob
thinks he would enjoy going if Charlie still actively wants to meet up, but
doesn't want to bother if they both feel this way.

    :shortdes: The remarkable compounding of small amounts of time
    :tags: Life | Statistics

.The average city dweller spends around four months of their life waiting at
red lights.

.If this sounds impossible, here's the math: suppose you average about five
minutes a day waiting at various red lights. (That's probably eight average
lights' worth of waiting? I definitely wait at more some days, but then there
are days I don't go much of anywhere since I work from home, so this seems
about right. I'd expect it to be more for people who have significant commutes.
If you take the subway or grade-separated light rail most of the time, you get
to skip most of the red lights, but then you wait for your train to arrive
instead.) That makes 1,825 minutes per year. Then we'll say you spend 60 years
of your life in the city and traveling around regularly (this is probably an
underestimate), for 109,500 total minutes spent at red lights. Divide by 60
again for hours, and by 16 for waking hours per day, and you get 114 waking
days spent waiting, or just under four months.

.Five minutes a day doesn't seem like much of a commitment. But actually it's a
<em>huge</em> one. You can get a lot done in five minutes a day if you're
<a href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#PowerOfKonsistency">consistent</a>.
You can also waste an enormous amount of time in five minutes a day if you're not
doing something worthwhile with it. (Exercise for the reader: can you do
something interesting while waiting at red lights?)

<div class="callout">

    <em>Rule of thumb</em>: 15 minutes a day is 1/60 of your time. If you spend
    15 minutes daily for a year, you will have spent 6 days (or 12 full-time
    work days) total; for 60 years, 1 year total.

</div>
