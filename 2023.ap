    :shortdes: The remarkable compounding of small amounts of time
    :tags: Life | Statistics

.The average city dweller spends around four months of their life waiting at
red lights.

.If this sounds impossible, here's the math: suppose you average about five
minutes a day waiting at various red lights. (That's probably eight average
lights' worth of waiting? I definitely wait at more some days, but then there
are days I don't go much of anywhere since I work from home, so this seems
about right. I'd expect it to be more for people who have significant
commutes.) That makes 1,825 minutes per year. Then we'll say you spend 60 years
of your life in the city and traveling around regularly (this is probably an
underestimate), for 109,500 total minutes spent at red lights. Divide by 60
again for hours, and by 16 for waking hours per day, and you get 114 waking
days spent waiting, or just under four months.

.Five minutes a day doesn't seem like much of a commitment. But actually it's a
<em>huge</em> one. You can get a lot done in five minutes a day if you're

You can also waste an enormous amount of time in five minutes a day if you're not
doing something worthwhile with it. (Exercise for the reader: can you do
something interesting while waiting at red lights?)

    <em>Rule of thumb</em>: 15 minutes a day is 1/60 of your time. If you spend
    15 minutes daily for a year, you will have spent 6 days (or 12 full-time
    work days) total; for 60 years, 1 year total.
