    :shortdes: The best part of remote work
    :tags: Personal

.…for me, once the pandemic finished up, was entirely unexpected. As a fairly
introverted person, I have a fixed budget of energy for spending time with
other people, and if I exceed that I get tired and cranky. Getting to spend
most of my work hours at home, or in public places that I choose based on my
mood and where I can come and go as I please, and only do some occasional video
calls and otherwise not have to talk to people at work at all, means I can use
almost all of that budget on hanging out with people I choose, rather than
more-or-less randomly-selected coworkers. This results in far more interesting
social situations and happiness created per unit of that energy budget!

.Of course, it also means I <em>have</em> to take on responsibility for
planning meetups and going places, or I'll end up spending all my time at home
alone being sad, because I am not automatically forced to interact with other
people at some point during the week. But that's definitely worth it.

    :shortdes: Incredibly basic questions we can't answer
    :tags: Life | Math | Science

.A <em>perfect number</em> is one whose factors, less itself, add up to itself.
For instance, the first perfect number is 6, and its factors are 1, 6, 2, and
3; 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. The second is 28, and its factors are 1, 28, 2, 14, 4, and 7;
1 + 2 + 14 + 4 + 7 = 28.

.Both of these numbers, as well as the next few, are even, so one naturally
asks, are all perfect numbers even? The answer turns out to be, unbelievably,
<em>we don't know</em>. Isn't that bonkers? This feels like the kind of basic
question that I – mathematically literate but no theoretical whiz – ought to be
able to sit down for a couple of hours and figure out, maybe with a couple of
hints. But over the entire course of human history, nobody has managed to
answer it. We can completely change the landscape, eradicate diseases, study
the behavior of impossibly small particles, and send people to the moon… but we
can't figure out if all perfect numbers are even.

.<a href="https://xkcd.com/2682/">Relevant xkcd</a> (as always) points out that
there are also questions which sound almost impossible to answer but are
actually pretty easy.

    :shortdes: I'm staying in Minneapolis
    :tags: Minneapolis | Personal

.For the last couple of months, I've been commenting to anyone who will listen
that I love Minneapolis and I can't explain why. (I like Minnesota in general,
especially when I'm out in nature, but I think I particularly like
Minneapolis.) Being out in the city reliably makes me feel happy and in my
element. And it feels like home to me in a way that nowhere else I've lived has
– I remember remarking just a few weeks after arriving that it already felt
like home, and it'll be two years next month.

.I still want to try to explain what I like about this place as best I can. But
I also had the realization this week that this is what Adam Mastroianni calls
“<a
href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/sorry-pal-this-woo-is-irreducible">irreducible
woo</a>”: an experience where trying to use reason to understand is not just
ineffective but actually a category error. Loving a place is just like loving a
person, even if it feels a little less intense: you can sit there and list out
what's so great about it all you want – and sometimes this is a useful exercise
– but you have to realize it doesn't get you any closer to understanding.
Thinking about some people I love, I can make my list and then look at the list
and realize that if every statement on that list magically became false
overnight, I would still love them. Love just isn't <em>about</em> something's
enumerated set of good qualities and fitness for you.

.So I love it here…but what if there's another place I could love even more?
My last home, in Owatonna, Minnesota, was a place I quite enjoyed living, but I
left with high confidence I was making the right choice because <a
href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#ConvinceMeToStay">I knew it was
limiting me and there were obviously better opportunities to explore
elsewhere</a>.

.But the Twin Cities feel entirely different. This is a place big enough and
varied enough that I can change and need and want almost entirely different
things, and still find them without moving again. It's a place that can grow
with me. It's a place that doesn't just feel like a nice enough place to be,
but also one that's made for me (however you choose to interpret the agency
there). And Owatonna – like everywhere else in my childhood and young
adulthood – pretty much always felt like a temporary stop on the way to a
permanent home. This feels like it can be the end of the line if I want it to
be.

.Granted, there almost certainly exists, somewhere, a “better” place for me,
and it's plausible I could find it if I made that my goal. But it's also
entirely plausible, perhaps more likely, that I could spend my whole life
floating from place to place hoping the next one was slightly better, maybe
even without getting anything better in the end – and meanwhile I'd be missing
out on the chance to make the long-term commitments that make a really good
life good. It's much smarter to say you know what, this is good on an absolute
scale, and it's about as good as I expect to get, and even though there
probably is a better place somewhere else, it's not worth the cost of trying to
find it, because making a serious commitment here and now improves this place,
and investing earlier is worth more in total.

.For me, the exploration phase is over and the <a
href="https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/exploration-vs-exploitation">exploitation
phase</a> is on. While on the micro level people <a
href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#Underexploration">tend to
underexplore</a>, people are so mobile nowadays that I think on the macro level
they tend to overexplore. Personally, I've never had a friendship that lasted
more than five years or so, or gotten to know every restaurant and institution
in even a small neighborhood. Isn't that worth doing? You can get <a
href="https://www.raptitude.com/2023/10/the-truth-is-always-made-of-details/">arbitrarily
deep</a>, and many of us have never gotten past the very highest levels. Not
only do you run out of time to get deeper if you leave in the middle, you often
can't even muster the energy to try to do it in the first place if you think
you're going to be leaving soon. When I believe I have two-thirds of a lifetime
ahead of me here, things that are valuable but require serious commitments of
time and energy to realize become obviously worth it.

.At this point, I'd leave the Twin Cities if I got an unsolicited, truly
amazingly awesome, job offer somewhere else that I couldn't reasonably refuse
or negotiate to remote, or if I fell in love with someone who had no choice but
to go somewhere else for their own reasons (I'm going to try to avoid getting
attached to someone in such a situation, but sometimes the universe has other
plans!), or of course if the metro somehow became vastly less livable, for me
or for everyone. Otherwise, this is my home now and I don't plan on leaving. I
don't know what 30 years from now will hold – or for that matter really even 5
years from now – so I am <a
href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#IntellectualHumility">not going
to claim to know</a> that I won't, but I am going to confidently say that I
don't foresee anything changing my mind. And I'm going to make it as hard as
practically possible to change my mind, to make it easier to stop
second-guessing myself.

.I've never lived in a place I've taken this seriously before; it's always
felt, at best, like I was a guest who might with a small chance decide to stay
for a long while. So this is a little bold and scary, but it's worth it.

.Today I took the practically trivial but psychologically significant step of
releasing the cell phone number I've had since 2007 and getting a new one in
the 612 area code. Over the next few months, aside from looking for more social
ties, I'm going to be deeply exploring a number of neighborhoods and looking
for a semi-permanent home, ideally something I can buy and keep until and
unless my life circumstances change enough that what's now appropriate no
longer is. (If you, by some bizarre chance, have any interesting leads on
moderately priced, old-construction, central-core condos or similar
opportunities for a single person, hit me up!) I might also end up continuing
to rent where I am – I did quite a bit of research to place myself here, too,
and it's a perfectly fine option, I'm just not sure yet if it's the best spot
to commit to.

.Publishing this is, of course, part of the commitment.

Mathematicians found a way to distinguish between any knot and the unknot by
simply setting an upper bound on the number of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reidemeister_move">Reidemeister moves</a>
needed to connect them. If you check all sequences of Reidemeister moves up to
that number, you can prove if the knot is the unknot or not. There's just one
problem: that upper bound was \( 2^{100,000,000,000n} \) moves.

Meta-analytic averages are not (meaningfully) capturing what happens at the
center of some platonic distribution of “dishonesty in coin-flip tasks”,
because that distribution does not exist. They are (meaninglessly) capturing
what researchers happened to do. And if they happened to do different things in
coin-flip tasks than in die-roll tasks, well, then you’re likely to find
different results in coin-flip tasks than in die-roll tasks. And that
meta-analyzed difference has no meaning.

.When you get exposed to rabies, the standard prophylaxis is composed of a
series of four vaccine shots against rabies, plus a shot of antibodies given
directly next to the wound – <em>rabies immunoglobulin</em>.

    :shortdes: Minimalist packing challenge
    :tags: Travel

.I'm about to head to Bali for two weeks for an off-site with my startup. I'm
flying on Sun Country and then EVA Air, both of which have wildly strict
carry-on baggage policies: Sun Country allows you only a personal item
(although a pretty large one) and no overhead bin space at all unless you pay
an extra $50, while EVA Air caps carry-on bags at 7 kg / 15 lbs (!) and allows
only extremely slim personal items of up to 4 inches tall.

.I hate checking luggage when I fly, and this looked like a straight challenge
to me (what could possibly be the point of a 7 kg carry-on limit except to
force people to unnecessarily check bags so you earn more money?), so I went
down a bit of an ultralight packing rabbit hole, and I'm delighted to report
that I succeeded at packing everything I need under these constraints! (At
least, I think so; my bag is <em>just</em> a tiny bit larger than the Sun
Country personal item size, but I'm pretty sure I'll be able to cram it into
the sizer since it's soft-sided. I can probably get away with taking my camera
or water bottle out first and holding or putting it in my pocket, too, in which
case it would definitely fit.)

<div class="callout">
EVA, incidentally, stands for “Evergreen Airways,” which means they suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome">RAS Syndrome</a>. Everything about them is designed to annoy me, apparently.
</div>

.I bought a few luggage items and clothes for this, but they were all things
that I wanted for other purposes or future trips anyway, so this was just a
convenient excuse.

.The key to beating the significantly different constraints of both airlines
was this handy little bag which is designed to double as a packing cube and
organizer and a shoulder bag. I put a bunch of the heaviest stuff in there and
then put it in the backpack, and when I transfer from Sun Country to EVA Air,
I'll take it out and carry it separately as a personal item.

<img width="600px" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/pc-sidekick.jpg" alt="Shoulder bag. Contents of images are described below each.">

.In here I put my camera (I could just use my phone, but I came out
significantly under the size and weight limits without it, so figured I might
as well bring it), Kindle, mouse, a deck of cards, some KN95 masks (yay
pandemics), elbow straps (yay tendinitis), a pencil and eraser (I didn't even
bring paper except my mini pocket notebook, but figure I might want to use some
somewhere else, and the eraser doubles as an amazingly excellent fidget toy if
my fingers get antsy on a flight or car ride), the cute little puck hairbrush,
and a pouch of hair ties and clips and other miscellaneous teeny items.

<img width="400px" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/pc-backpack.jpg" alt="Backpack.">

.My main bag is this Tom Bihn Synapse 25 backpack I recently bought for
multi-purpose use as a daily bag around town and as a small travel bag. It
lists a 25L volume, but I swear it's a Bag of Holding; maybe because all the
compartments were designed so thoughtfully, it comfortably fits more stuff than
I can fit in bags I've owned that were advertised as 30 or 35 liters. I threw
the modular hip straps on for this trip since it's going to be a little heavy
for a day pack.

<img width="600px" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/pc-main.jpg" alt="Contents of main pocket spread on the floor.">

.In the main pocket, I have most of the clothes I packed: a T-shirt, a wool
undershirt, a short-sleeved linen button-down, a pair of khaki shorts, a
swimsuit, and a baseball cap. (I'll wear a light sweater and a pair of jeans,
and one more of everything else, on the way. That keeps the heaviest stuff out
of the bag; plus anytime I fly to a warm place, the plane seems to be fifteen
degrees cooler than anything else I experience on the entire trip, so I
definitely want the sweater!) Also a travel blanket (I love this thing – as a
thin square piece of wool, it can also double as a bathrobe, beach towel, sun
shield, scarf, carrying bag, etc.); a manila folder with my itinerary, visa,
immunization records, and so on; a toiletry bag; a fancy liquids bag to make
airport security happy; and a computer. The MacBook Air is by far the heaviest
item in my bag, tipping the scales at 1.38 kg, fully a fifth of my weight limit
– but you can't go to a startup offsite without a laptop! Plus it means I don't
have to also bring a notebook, tablet, etc. The laptop sleeve, which is sold
with the backpack, is metal-free and slides out, as you can see in the picture,
so in theory you don't have to remove it and put it in a bin at airport
security; we'll see if the TSA drones actually accept that.

In addition to that stuff, in the one-bag configuration the shoulder bag goes
in this pocket on top.

<img width="600px" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/pc-main-packed.jpg" alt="Main pocket, everything packed.">

<img width="400px" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/pc-water.jpg" alt="Water bottle sticking out of pocket.">

.The center water bottle pocket on this bag is brilliant; it allows the side
pockets to be extremely deep and way more useful than on most bags, and means
you don't need those stupid mesh pockets on the side which make the bag go
off-kilter when you put a full bottle in one. Obviously, bottle empty if the
bag is getting weighed!

<img width="600px" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/pc-front.jpg" alt="Contents of front pocket on top of the bag.">

.In the front pocket, passport, money pouch, more masks, safety pin for
wardrobe malfunctions, and AirTag (just in case I somehow manage to lose my
only bag!).

<img width="400px" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/pc-right.jpg" alt="Contents of side pocket laid out.">
<img width="600px" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/pc-cables.jpg" alt="Contents of the pouch (in side pocket) on the floor.">

.One side pocket has an address tag, 6 feet of paracord, and a cable kit. In
the kit, a plug adapter, USB-C power supply, my <a href="#post-124">universal
charging cable</a>, a 6-inch USB-C cable to crossfeed from my laptop to another
device in case my Kindle or phone dies on a flight while I'm charging the
laptop, earbuds, and the usual adapter suspects (for headphones on planes with
the old entertainment-system audio plugs, headphones to an iPhone, and USB-A
devices to my MacBook; I don't have any USB-A devices or cables with me, but
I've been burned by not having this adapter and needing to plug in someone
else's device so many times that I won't leave home without it in my laptop
bag anymore).

<img width="400px" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/pc-left.jpg" alt="Contents of the other side pocket laid out.">

.Other side has my boar-bristle hairbrush (a good use of space because it lets
me go an extra day in between washes without my hair getting gross) and
sunglasses.

<img width="600px" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/pc-bottom.jpg" alt="Contents of the bottom pocket laid out.">

.Bottom pocket has a pair of ultralight hiking sandals / water shoes (still
tipping the scales at 440 grams), three pairs of underwear, two pairs of socks,
and two handkerchiefs (always useful). The underwear and socks are specially
rated for travel, although I've been wearing the Ex Officio underwear at home
since I learned about them; they're great everywhere. The socks are new merino
wool. I wore a pair for three days in a row at home without washing them to
test the claim that they could be worn multiple times – you could barely tell
they had been worn at all after two days, and after three they were noticeably
used but still not unpleasant either on my feet or held up to my nose.

<img width="400px" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/pc-scale.jpg" alt="Backpack hanging from a luggage scale.">

And that's it! 8.2 kg total. With the shoulder bag weighing about 1.5 kg, 7 kg
for the backpack is reached with a little margin for error.

    <li><strong>Worst (intentional) score on an SAT practice test</strong>: 600 on the three-part test, the minimum possible on the practice exam scoring. (This happens when you're a nerdy teenager and have a very boring Saturday morning. This is harder than it sounds; you get a worse score by answering wrong than by leaving the question blank, so you can't just leave things blank for a minimum score, and the wrong answers are well-selected enough that you still have to read all the passages and do parts of the math problems to be able to definitively select a wrong answer! I think I got two questions right by accident, which wasn't worth any points on the curve.)
    <li><strong>Worst (unintentional) score in Yahtzee</strong>: 127. (This happens when you play several thousand games of Yahtzee over the years with your mother, and thus have time to get exceedingly unlucky once in a while despite also getting very good at Yahtzee. I feel confident saying we've played several thousand games because we've had to reorder Yahtzee score sheets on at least two occasions, and there are 240 two-player games per pad and usually three to four of those in a box.)
    <li><strong>Longest journal entry</strong>: August 8, 2015, 27 pages. I average 250 words per page in this type of notebook. (This happens when you go to Chicago with your parents to meet friends you haven't seen in 15 years and you talk about everything and start thinking about everything.)</li>
    <li><strong>Longest time spent talking after church</strong>: July 9, 2023, 3 hours 10 minutes from when the service finished to when I left, with no scheduled events in between. (This happens when you start talking with your best friend and then you have to move up to an isolated room on the third floor of the church because an old lady in a bad mood yells at you to stop talking in the narthex during the second service, so you don't notice that it's 1 PM and you're the only people left in the church building.)</li>

    :tags: Tech | Travel

.I recently learned that they make these cute little adapter plugs for charging
cables. Together with the astounding battery life of the newest MacBook Air,
I've been able to cut down the cableage that I carry in my backpack to a single
USB-C cable with strapped-on adapter plugs plus a 65W Anker AC adapter. All of
my electronics can charge from a USB-C, Lightning, or micro-USB connector, so
this single cable can charge everything I ever carry with me.

<img width="400px" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/universal-charger.jpg" alt="A USB-C cable with micro-USB and USB-C adapters attached to it by flexible rubber cabling, plus a wall adapter for a USB-C cable and a universal international travel plug adapter.">

.This does save a little space and weight, but not that much; the real benefit
is that my cables never get tangled and I can instantly find the one I need,
because there's only one of them!

.The obvious limitation here is that you can only charge one device at a time,
but this isn't really a big deal – if I'm away from home for a while and all my
batteries are flat, I can just charge up the laptop when I'm near an outlet and
then boost the other devices from there.

.If I'm traveling internationally, I throw in the universal AC plug adapter too
and I'm all set.

I wrote a couple of years ago about
<a href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/inclusion/">
welcome and inclusion in online communities</a>,
focusing on a debacle created by the management of Q&A network Stack Exchange.
Since then, the company has limped along in uneasy relations with the community,
until this June, when a very poorly considered policy on contributions
that use GPT-4 made everyone furious again. This time, there was a
two-month strike by the volunteer moderators, where they refused to help keep
the site running, which ended a few days ago in negotiations between the
moderators and the company and appears to have led to some useful policy changes.
Only time will tell whether the company will keep their word, though.

</p><p>I love unusual labor situations like this; how often do you see volunteers
striking? It goes to show how important online communities like this are to
people, that they will go on strike rather than just leave.

.I learned today that the letter Q was banned in Turkey from 1928 to 2013,
along with X and W. People who used these letters in official documents,
signs, their children's names, etc., were actually jailed on multiple
occasions.

.Evidently this is because these letters are used in Kurdish and not in
Turkish, and the Turkish government spent decades trying to wipe out that
language and culture.

someone adds a “Because We Can Fee” or “Extra Revenue Fee” or something to that

had to add a surcharge to pay for it. Whatever happened to <em>your menu

    :shortdes: Small talk doesn't work over text
    :tags: Design | Life | Society

.I've been having a lot of text conversations on dating apps recently, and
I think I've figured out a few ways to make them better.

.Most people find texting strangers awkward and difficult. Texting is already a
medium that could almost have been purpose-built to amplify miscommunications
and social anxiety; it has all the bad aspects of email (inability to read any
nuances besides the literal words, looks different on one device than another,
asynchronous with long delays in between responses), with the added flaw that
you're encouraged to write as little as possible on a keyboard that's hard to
use. But at least if you're texting someone you know well, you can make
reasonable guesses about the person's motivation and frame of mind when they
wrote. With someone you know nothing about besides a few words on a screen and
maybe a short bio of varying quality, you're starting out with a massive
handicap.

.Here's a key result: small talk, far from being important social glue as it is
in person, actively works against good interactions in text. Small talk, in
person, works because it's not about the content at all; it's a pretext to read
the other person's mood and intent and conversational style for a couple
minutes before you say anything risky. But over text, you can't read any of
this – you only get the actual words the person says, plus a few side-channel
cues that are as likely to be wrong as right (e.g., if someone takes a long
time to respond, we often conclude they're disinterested or unsure what they
should say, but really they probably just left their phone on the other side of
the room). The result is that when you engage in small talk over text, you are
literally just talking about the weather or how many siblings you have or
whatever. That's enough to bore anyone to death, so after a few back and
forths, someone almost inevitably wanders away. (In a romantic context, too
much of this can actually make the person seem less interesting and attractive,
to the point that you no longer care about them, even when you <em>know</em> it
was an utterly mechanical problem and you learned no important new information
about them from the small-talk conversation!)

.The good thing is that with the indirectness of a screen between two people,
they usually don't need the period of small talk to be comfortable talking
about something more substantive right away. Think about how much more direct
office emails are than meetings: it's common to start off a meeting by chatting
for a couple minutes, perhaps while people are filtering in, but extremely rare
to write this kind of chatter in an email; you'd rather walk over and catch up
if you had news to share. (I think this is one of the reasons remote work can
feel so isolating; even video calls tend to get much more quickly to the point
than in-person interaction.)

.So I think it's better to just jump in. In support of this theory, every time
I can remember having a <em>good</em> text conversation with a stranger, it has
almost immediately gotten either (1) detailed and geeky or (2) vulnerable and
meaningful. Try it and see: start at a somewhat higher level of intimacy than
you would in person and escalate faster from there.

.Another important consideration is that it's particularly important for
text-only conversations to <a
href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/good-conversations-have-lots-of-doorknobs">
have lots of doorknobs</a>. This means making provocative statements, asking
deep questions, and, above all and maybe counterintuitively for the medium,
trying to keep more than one thread of conversation moving at once. Every topic
naturally dies down eventually, and it happens faster than usual over text
where responding is effortful and you tend to think harder about each
statement and put more ideas into it. If you find you have nothing you
particularly want to say in response to a particular message and you have no
other topic to fall back on, it feels awkward and difficult to come up with a
new one when you can't see the other person and “feel the room” – especially
one that's not small talk – to the point that it sometimes feels easier to just
end the conversation even if you were enjoying it. Instead, write a couple
sentences at a time about two to three different things in each message (or in
separate texts that immediately follow each other every time you respond).

.Lastly, if your goal in having a text conversation is to get comfortable
enough to suggest meeting in person, do that as soon as you can, maybe just a
little bit before you feel comfortable doing so. The longer you go on in an
impoverished medium, the more likely someone does something that makes the
whole thing seem stale.

    :shortdes: The entanglement of badly designed architecture and badly designed societies
    :tags: Design | Society

.In my <a href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#Questions">
list of unanswered questions about the world</a>, I wrote:

<blockquote>
    How can we consistently build places that have what [Christopher
    Alexander] calls the [quality without a name]? Everyone can immediately
    recognize places that have it, and most of us are forced to live and
    work in places that don't, which has a clear negative impact on our
    quality of life. Does Alexander's failure to consistently create these
    places despite more or less spending a lifetime studying it mean we're
    doomed to throw buildings at the wall and see which ones stick, or is
    there some other reason his pattern language didn't solve the problem?
</blockquote>

.Recently reading Alexander's <em>A Pattern Language</em>, I've come to realize
I've been looking at the problem all wrong, and I'm slightly embarrassed that I
didn't figure it out earlier. I've been fascinated by the impact of places on
our lives and behavior for a long time, and that, I think, is in itself the
answer to the question. The book, and the system of thought behind it, is at
least as much a political and social philosophy as an architectural handbook.
That's because places don't stand alone and have no influence on our lives (if
they didn't, this would be purely an aesthetic problem, while in reality it
goes much deeper). Rather, our bad architecture and design – both private and
public – is both a cause and a result of a series of social problems:
atomization, lack of connection to other humans and the world around us,
unbridled capitalism, disproportionate influence of the wealthy, excessive use
of debt, bad ideologies, and on and on.

.Which makes the problem even more important and more challenging to solve, but
it also suggests that improving one's space can provide part of a way out.
While some patterns are much larger-scale than others – some can be
implemented by moving furniture around your room, while others require the
cooperation of an entire society – the whole project can be implemented
in a bottom-up fashion. You can make your own spaces better, convince a few
people who see the effect, join forces with them, work on the next level, and
so on. And if you succeed, even a little bit, you can't help but improve the
world.

    :shortdes: What if friends became physically more like each other?
    :tags: Brainteaser

.I was out walking around the lake with a friend and ribbing her about being
habitually unsteady on her feet, when suddenly <em>I</em> tripped on a bulge in
the asphalt walkway. She joked, “You're turning into me!”

.Which sent me off on this bizarre line of speculation: There's an old saw
about how you're the average of the five people you spend the most time with.
What if this were true not just mentally, but <em>physically</em>? What would
the world be like? Suppose it's a gradual effect; every hour you spend with
someone makes the two of you look very slightly more alike.

.Would people have enough connections and spend sufficiently similar amounts of
time with each of them that most people would eventually look alike? Or would
the world diverge into little clusters of similar people? Or maybe most people
would be the same, and then some people would resist and end up in little
cliques of totally different-looking people? (I called this the “Australia
theory,” as in, where one group stays geographically isolated for a really long
time and ends up totally different from everyone else.) People's jobs might
play a big role here; corporate-drone-style jobs would probably become even
more dystopian.

.I think this would be a nightmare for discrimination of various kinds. Just to
start with the most obvious example, if you're not very attractive, you could
make yourself more attractive by hanging out with better-looking people; but by
doing so you would make them <em>less</em> attractive, so presumably they
wouldn't be very interested in spending time with you unless they really cared
about you for other reasons. On the other hand, people could essentially
selectively breed themselves by making friends with people who had appropriate
characteristics. If you had, say, too large a nose for your taste and someone
else had too small a nose for theirs, you could join up. Or maybe you have a
desirable body type and someone else has a better-looking face, and you're both
happy to become a little more average on both counts.

.Presumably most of the world would become androgynous, except for a few people
who cared so much about preserving their physical gendered characteristics that
they were willing to hide from people of another gender. Although – if
reproductive organs aren't special-cased, maybe everyone would die out
eventually in that case, and people would actually have to spend almost all of
their time in sex-segregated spaces just to keep humanity alive? Though I guess
we didn't say whether your genes are affected; conceivably this could reset
when you have children.

.Depending on how fast change happened and whether you actually had to interact
to get the effect or whether you just had to be in proximity, you could have
people sneaking along behind celebrities or athletes trying to leech off of
them.

.I suppose the real question is, shouldn't we be thinking about this with our
personalities when we choose who we hang out with? Because most of these
dynamics could be real, just in a different sphere! Hmm…

    :source: https://controlaltbackspace.org/nachos
    :tags: Blog | Life

It's easy to evaluate experiences or our entire lives primarily based on tiny
parts of them that make us feel particularly strongly, especially negatively.
This makes it possible to feel bad about an experience that was, overall, good.
How can we bring the big-picture perspective into our lives sooner and more
consistently?

</p><p>
For kicks, I asked ChatGPT if it could explain what this essay was about, based
only on the title. It did remarkably well, about as well as I'd expect a human
to do:
</p><p>

<details>
    <summary>Response</summary>

    <blockquote>
    <p> While I don't have specific information on this exact essay, I can make an
    educated guess based on the title. "Don't Measure the Quality of Your Life
    Using the Temperature of Your Nachos" likely serves as a metaphorical piece of
    advice. </p>

    <p> It could mean that one should not judge their life's quality based on
    fleeting or trivial matters (the temperature of nachos being an example of
    something relatively insignificant). Nachos are a consumable item, and their
    temperature is a transitory quality that changes quickly and doesn't
    substantially impact the overall experience of having and eating the nachos.
    </p>

    <p> Translating this to life, the essay might be discussing how people often
    place too much importance on the temporary, fleeting aspects of their lives
    (akin to the temperature of nachos). These might be material possessions,
    transient successes, momentary failures, or temporary physical conditions. </p>

    <p> Instead, the essay likely argues that we should focus more on enduring and
    significant aspects of our lives: our relationships, personal growth,
    achievements, and overall happiness and well-being. It could also suggest that
    true life satisfaction and success are not determined by ephemeral or
    superficial factors but by more profound, more meaningful aspects of life. </p>

    <p> These are just educated guesses, and the actual content of the essay might
    differ based on the author's thoughts and perspectives. </p>

    :shortdes: Why we don't have highly effective, reversible male contraceptives
    :tags: Life | Science | Society

.Will I ever shut up about contraception? Not sure.

.Anyhow, random soapbox today: a little while ago I <a href="#post-92">did a
RemNote workflow video involving an article</a> that advanced an argument
similar to one I've had for quite a few years. I was relieved and encouraged to
find a professional had written about this and I apparently am not crazy! The
issue here is not entirely limited to contraception, that's just a place where
the wrongness of the assumptions involved becomes most clear (and there are a
couple of special factors that make it worse).

.Problem under consideration: development of any highly effective, reversible
contraceptives for men has been repeatedly stymied by ethics boards. The
concerns have been over side effects: according to the boards, the side effects
are too bad to make continuing the studies ethical.

.First issue: if you actually ask the people involved in the studies, large
majorities of them have said the side effects were tolerable and they liked the
drugs. In the last one I read about, somewhere around 20% of people wanted to
stop. But…that's fine? Nobody is forcing you to use any particular
contraceptive (or, indeed, any at all). If you don't like the side effects of a
drug which serves a function for which there are many other options, you can
simply not take it and try something else; because some people don't get along
well with it is not a valid reason to tell other people who do that they aren't
allowed to have it.

.Second issue: the side effects are comparable to those women deal with on
hormonal contraceptives. If we're OK with those (and it seems we are), then why
shouldn't we be OK with sticking men with similar ones? The problem here is
often mistakenly reported as something to the effect of “men are sissies and
can't deal with the side effects.” While this certainly might be a factor for
some potential users, the evidence is inconsistent with this being a cause of
the development problems – as noted above, most men who have taken the trial
drugs have been happy with them and wanted to continue, and the discontinuance
rate is no higher than for women. The problem is instead that <em>review boards
tell people they can't keep taking them</em>. How's that for patriarchy?

.The ethical argument for different treatment here goes like this: women can
get pregnant and thus suffer various health harms, so the side effect profile
of a drug designed to prevent that can be much worse than for men and still be
ethically acceptable. But this only sounds like a good argument until you give
it even a superficial look. Yeah, (biological) men can't get pregnant, but
presumably men would not be trying to take contraceptives unless they were at
risk of getting someone else pregnant. Sex is a mutual decision of two people;
why is the person who's able to get physically pregnant solely responsible for
mitigating risks? In fact, the author of the paper I mentioned above makes a
very good argument that men should take on as much of this risk as practical to
make things more even – women get the risks of being pregnant, men get the side
effects of the contraception. And not to belabor the point, but most users of
highly effective reversible contraceptives would be people in long-term
romantic relationships. There's something fundamentally absurd about refusing
to allow people to share risks and responsibilities in a relationship which is
in substantial part defined by the people in it agreeing to share risks and
responsibilities as much as possible!

.In general, ethics review boards need to take a chill pill. Writ large,
they seem to be incapable of considering opportunity costs. Can it possibly be
unethical to allow people who, with full understanding and consent, want to
continue taking some experimental drugs and participating in a study the
results of which could improve the lives of millions of people, to do that? I
think it's pretty messed up to <em>not</em> allow that. Yeah, a few people
might be hurt a little bit, but they agreed to take that risk. This is not the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study">Tuskegee
Syphilis Study</a> and is not at risk of becoming it. If we are only willing to
allow things that are 100% safe, or 99.9999% safe, we're never going to achieve
anything ever again, even walking to the grocery store to buy some milk. At
least knock a couple of those nines off when you have
<a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-radical-idea-that-people-arent">smart</a>,
well-informed people agreeing to be part of the discovery process.

    :shortdes: Winning at Kavka's and Newcomb's Problems by making extra commitments
    :tags: Brainteaser

.<a href="#post-98">Previously</a>, I suggested that winning a million dollars
in Kavka's toxin puzzle is impossible because you can never intend to drink
poison when you know you can change your mind penalty-free at a later time, and
suggested this might call my <a href="#post-97">solution to Newcomb's
Problem</a> into question as well. (If you haven't read those posts, do that
now, or this one won't make much sense.) But could you make it rational to
actually drink the poison by voluntarily committing yourself to doing so,
outside of the eccentric billionaire's frame? Then you could rationally intend
to drink it as well.

.For instance, after receiving the poison and before midnight, you could bet a
friend $1,000 that you'll actually drink it. (If you want, you can give
yourself bad odds so your friend doesn't owe you a full $1,000 if you do drink
it.) Now you'll lose $1,000 if you don't actually drink it, and it's rational
to drink it the next day, regardless of whether you intended to at midnight.

.There's a straightforward objection to this strategy as stated though: is it
rational to drink poison to avoid losing just 1% of your winnings, when you've
just won a million dollars? (Another way to frame it: if you have the choice
between $999,000 with no strings attached, or $1,000,000 but you have to be
horribly sick for a day, would you really choose the second option?) One school
of thought says of course, because you wouldn't win anything if you didn't do
this, but if you're going to make that argument I'm not sure you've gained
anything by applying this betting strategy – it's more or less the same as
arguing that you can intend to drink the poison because that makes you win,
which might be true but is basically circular and doesn't address the problem
of being free to change your mind.

.You could try to address this objection by betting enough to bankrupt yourself
if you didn't drink it – say, $200,000 – but you might run into practical
problems getting anyone to take the other side of this bet. If you make the
odds anywhere close to fair, probably nobody would take it. If you make them,
say, 1/100,000, so that you pay $200,000 if you lose and earn $2 if you win,
nobody would take you seriously and the courts might not enforce the contract
if you lost. Maybe another eccentric billionaire with a different take on the
problem would be game for even odds, but good luck finding them in the hours
you have to arrange a bet.

.Maybe we'll actually come off better if we don't bet <em>money</em>, because
we tend to think much more objectively about money than, say, social status.
What if you just told everyone you knew that you're really going to do it –
because it's the winning strategy – and you're a loser if you don't? Or you
could try to go viral on Twitter with the story and promise to update everyone
when you won. (This is probably a bad idea for the same reason that you
shouldn't tell anyone you won the lottery, but I bet it would work.) I'm sure
you could come up with similar creative ideas.

.In the Newcomb's Problem context: you could agree with a friend now that if
you ever play the game and win excess money by two-boxing, you'll give the
$1,000 to them and they'll donate it to a charity you hate. Now two-boxing has
negative utility compared to one-boxing in all conditions: you'll never end up
with more money, <em>and</em> some money might go to making the world worse (in
your opinion). Of course, you could still renege on the agreement, but assuming
you're a person who normally honors their commitments, I think this would be
enough to make two-boxing unattractive.

    :shortdes: Is it OK to sell more success on dating apps?
    :tags: Life | Society

.The dating app Hinge recently introduced a new subscription tier which
essentially gives you priority over other users when it shows profiles to
potential matches. As always, the details of their algorithm aren't public
knowledge, but essentially if you pay more, your profile gets shown to more
people more often, and your messages even get bumped up higher on other
people's lists.

.I genuinely can't figure out what I think of this.

.<strong>Argument for this being cringey, weird, and unethical:</strong>
Why, if Alice has more money to throw around than Bob,
should she have more success meeting people?
People with less money
<a href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#RelationshipSuccessDivide">
are already disadvantaged in the success rates of their ongoing relationships</a>;
now we're also making it even harder for them to meet people in the first place?
Then, this feels uncomfortably close to patronizing some sort of escort service:
you're paying extra to get more romantic attention from people.

.Also, any mechanic like this on a dating app feels a bit manipulative.
Most app makers have to come up with sneaky ways to make their apps feel addictive,
while dating apps barely have to do anything because they're already working with
one of the most powerful sources of intrinsic motivation most people have.
Just pay us a little more and you, too, can find love!
(On the other hand, this, as a subscription fee,
 is still much better on that front than other mechanics where you pay per message,
 or per short attention boost;
 at least it isn't, essentially, gambling.)

.<strong>Argument for this being totally sensible and normal:</strong> Dating
apps are in the business of selling you the attention of other people who might
be interested in you. Essentially, it's just a highly specialized advertising
platform. If I want to put an advertisement in the newspaper, I can pay less
for a small ad or more for a large ad; that's as expected, because the large ad
takes more space and captures more of readers' attention (a limited resource).
It doesn't really feel unfair that some people can't afford to take out a
larger ad in the newspaper, or seem like (at least without more context) you're
being desperate or taking advantage of other people by taking out a larger ad.
I certainly don't think the newspaper should only be allowed to sell one size
of ad!

.To bring this even a little closer to the model under discussion, if I
advertise online, I typically pay per view (or sometimes per click). By
purchasing a more expensive subscription, I'm essentially just saying I want to
pay for more views. Hinge's platform collectively has a certain number of
profile-views per day among people I might want to advertise to in my area (I
dunno, a couple hundred thousand?), and by paying more I get a larger chunk of
those. So unless you think that paying to advertise yourself to others is
already cringey, weird, or unethical, this mechanic doesn't seem like it ought
to be either.

.<strong>What about match quality?:</strong> There is one other, perhaps slightly
darker, thing going on here, though: the highest tier uses a more effective
algorithm to decide who to show you. To understand this, notice that the
entire incentive structure for all dating apps is fundamentally misaligned, at
least if you're looking for something that lasts longer than a hookup.
Subscription-based (and ad-supported) apps only make money while you're using
them, so they have an incentive to give you <em>just</em> as much luck as will
keep you from getting bored and walking away, so you have to spend more time on
the app. It's to their direct disadvantage to quickly create successful
relationships! (This is
<a href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/commodity/#1-the-degradation-of-web-search-and-content">
the same problem web search has</a>.) So I wouldn't be at all surprised if they
essentially have a “goodness” parameter to their model where if you pay less,
it intentionally hobbles the predictions and shows you more people who aren't a
very good match, so you have to spend more time to get to people you're
actually interested in.

.On the other hand, is that so bad? Pretend for a moment the highest tier is
the default, and they offer you a 30% discount (or whatever it winds up being)
if you agree to spend some of your time rejecting bad matches, and thus
probably end up spending more time on the platform. This doesn't seem that much
different from an ad-supported free version, or from clipping coupons, or from
churning credit cards; you're just choosing to pay with time or attention
instead of money from your bank account. You can decide you don't like ads, or
coupons, and buy the more expensive version, and you might have strong feelings
about ads being a bad way to monetize things given their effects on people's
attention and happiness – but you probably don't think it's unethical that
people are simply offering you the opportunity to pay for the product with a
different kind of resource if you so choose.

.Maybe the confusion comes from this: If we look at the situation from a
consequentialist viewpoint and consider society-wide equity and the ugliness of
commercializing intimate relationships (or the effects of omnipresent
advertising), the situation looks pretty bad. But nobody is trying to cheat
anyone else here or intentionally offer them a raw deal; if you take the system
as a given, everyone within it is behaving rationally and even fairly.

.I wish we had a better system, but I guess I'll begrudgingly participate in
the one we have for the time being!

    :shortdes: Does Kavka's toxin puzzle refute my solution to Newcomb's Problem?
    :tags: Brainteaser

.In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavka%27s_toxin_puzzle">Kavka's
toxin puzzle</a>, an eccentric billionaire gives you a vial of poison. Drinking
the poison will make you violently ill for a day, but won't kill you or cause
any long-term health effects. She offers you $1,000,000 if, tomorrow at
midnight, you intend to drink the poison that afternoon.

.Unless you're very rich, you presumably think that a million dollars is worth
being ill for a day, so this seems like a good deal. But the deal is
potentially even better: you don't even have to actually drink the poison to
get the money, you just have to intend to at midnight. You're always free to
change your mind.

.The problem is, is this game winnable at all? Kavka argues that it's
unwinnable for any rational actor, because you can never legitimately intend to
drink the poison. After midnight, there is no way that drinking the poison can
benefit you, so unless you start behaving irrationally after midnight, you will
never drink it. So unless you don't think about it very hard in advance (which
seems ridiculous given that you're being offered a million dollars if you set
your intention correctly), you <em>know</em> you'll change your mind, so you
can't be said to intend to drink the poison.

.But this suggests my <a href="#post-97">solution to Newcomb's Problem</a> might
have an issue: it seems that “after midnight” is logically equivalent to “after
the Predictor has made their prediction.” Switching your strategy to two-boxing
after the prediction has occurred can only benefit you, so can you actually
intend to one-box, as I say you should?

.I can only say that one-boxing <em>feels</em> rational to me in a way that
drinking the poison doesn't, although I can't quite explain why. And this
actually seems relevant; the Predictor's choice doesn't depend on logic, it
depends on what I will in fact do. If I fully believe I can get myself to
one-box, I win (and, in fact, I win regardless of whether I stick with it or
stop believing my strategy and defect at the last minute).

    :shortdes: Newcomb's Problem
    :tags: Brainteaser

.Here's a fascinating, infuriating, and unsolved philosophy problem. Suppose you
are called into a room that has two boxes on the table, which we'll call Box A
and Box B. Box A is clear and you can see that it contains $1,000. Box B is
opaque, but you know that it contains either $1,000,000 or nothing. You have a
choice: you can (1) take only box B, or (2) take both boxes. Whatever boxes you
take, you walk away with any contents, no strings attached.

.Here's the catch. The contents of box B were determined yesterday as follows:
an extremely accurate, although not necessarily infallible, Predictor (this
could be God, a computer, or whatever you like) made a prediction about which
option you would choose. You have high confidence in the Predictor's ability to
predict your behavior; you've seen them do this many times before, and they have
never been wrong. If the Predictor thought you would choose option (1), taking
only box B, box B contains $1,000,000. If the Predictor thought you would choose
option (2), taking both boxes, box B contains nothing.

.What should you choose? Most people are sure they know the right answer when
they first encounter the problem. The only thing is, people are split about
50/50, and both arguments seem right!

<div class="callout">
Note that we make the Predictor extremely accurate, rather than infallible, to
prevent any questions of whether you have free will from affecting the correct
choice; that isn't the point of the problem.
</div>

.<strong>The argument for two-boxing</strong>: Whether the Predictor put
$1,000,000 or nothing in the box, you end up $1,000 richer if you take both
boxes than if you take only box B – so how could it possibly make sense to
choose only box B? The contents of box B are already fixed by the time you play,
so which option you select cannot change the outcome. Imagine the back of box B
is clear and your partner is sitting on the other side; do they really want you
to leave $1,000 on the table? If you're tempted to one-box because you might be
missing something and $1,000 doesn't matter to you but $1,000,000 would be
life-changing, what if we change the problem so there's $500,000 in box A and
$1,000,000 in box B? This doesn't affect the logic or causality, but surely you
have to take both boxes now?

.<strong>The argument for one-boxing</strong>: Consider the four possible
conditions and their payoffs when you play this game:

<ol>
    <li>You one-box and the Predictor predicted you would one-box: $1,000,000</li>
    <li>You two-box and the Predictor predicted you would two-box: $1,000</li>
    <li>You one-box and the Predictor predicted you would two-box: $0</li>
    <li>You two-box and the Predictor predicted you would one-box: $1,001,000</li>
</ol>

.Now you know the Predictor is almost certainly correct, by definition. This
means cases (3) and (4) are extremely unlikely to happen; unless you lower your
confidence in the Predictor's judgment quite a lot, they won't come
significantly into the calculation. This leaves you with cases (1) and (2) to
worry about. You exclusively control whether (1) or (2) comes about by deciding
how many boxes to take, and (1) has a vastly higher value than (2), so
obviously you should choose option (1) and take only box B. Even if you change
the payout for box A so that it's, say, $500,000, as suggested above, this
logic continues to hold for most values of “almost certainly correct.” (If you
have low enough confidence in the Predictor, or you have an insurance-esque
mindset where you'd rather have a certain $500,000 than a nearly-certain
$1,000,000, the appropriate strategy might change. If you feel like wasting
more time on this problem, you could calculate the break-even point!)

.<strong>My contention:</strong> The correct strategy depends on whether you've
seen the problem before. If you've never heard of the problem and you're invited
to play the game with the Predictor having already chosen, you should two-box:
it's too late for one-boxing to buy you anything. But if you've thought about
the problem, the winning strategy is to <em>be the type of person who
one-boxes</em>, and to legitimately and wholeheartedly plan to take only box B,
because at this point you can influence the Predictor's prediction by changing
your intended strategy. If you can pull that off, you're nearly guaranteed to
become a millionaire should you ever have the opportunity to play this silly
game. (Simon Burgess <a
href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-010-9816-1">also makes
this argument</a>.)

    :shortdes: Save 80% on your Upper Midwest AC costs with one fan and an easy routine
    :tags: Design | Life

.I finally got my window air-conditioning unit installed yesterday, naturally
right near the end of the unseasonable heat wave. (Last year I put it in by
myself and came uncomfortably close to dropping it out the second-story window,
so I wanted someone over to help.)

.I was also thinking, though – it seems like a lot of folks around here have no
idea how to make the house comfortable without air conditioning. In a moderate
summer climate like Minnesota's that usually has large day/night temperature
swings, you can be totally comfortable without turning on the AC on 80–90% of
days, which will save a ton of money and energy.

.To be clear, I'm no climate-control cheapskate. If it gets unpleasant with no
AC, I cheerfully turn it on! But you really don't need it most of the time, and
this is coming from someone who hates warm weather. So here's the five-minute
version…because that's all there is to it.

<div class="callout">
<i>Note:</i> This works reliably in older buildings that were designed before AC
was common. It still works in a lot of newer buildings, but once in a while you
get one that was designed so poorly it's very hard to keep cool otherwise. Smart
architecture has disappeared over the last couple of decades.
</div>

.The trick here, if you can call it that, is simple: get a window fan, and when
it gets cooler outside than inside in the evening, open the windows and turn on
your window fan to draw the cool air inside. Keep them open with the air
circulating until the temperature starts to rise again in the morning. (I
usually have enough residual heat in my apartment that the indoor temperature
doesn't completely equalize overnight, so I instead close up when it gets warmer
outside than inside, even if the temperature has started rising somewhat before
that.)

.Don't stop circulating air earlier than you have to just because the temperature
seems equalized. Keeping cool air moving around will ensure that not just the
air, but also all the <em>stuff</em> in your home, gets as cool as possible.
When heavy materials like wood and tile get thoroughly cooled, they essentially
store cool for the day ahead – the heat that later moves into the space during
the warm day will warm it up and get trapped in it.

.Around here, on a typical
day, it usually gets cooler outside at around 8 PM, and warmer again at around 9
AM the next morning. If you have to leave before the outdoor temperature has
equalized, close up just before you leave.

.That's all you really need to know, but here are some more tips if you're not
sure how to accomplish that best:

<ul>
<li>
If you have lots of windows that form a great cross-breeze, you might be able
to get away with circulating air by just opening the windows. You'll still get
better results with a good window fan, though, and you'll need one for sure in
buildings that don't have windows on multiple sides. If you don't have one you
like already, shoot for a high-volume “whole-house” one like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Air-King-9166F-Whole-Window/dp/B0007Q3RQ6/ref=zg_bs_3737641_sccl_14/138-3144119-6653244?psc=1">this</a>;
these babies cost a couple hundred bucks but will last a lifetime, and one is
enough for all but the largest houses. Make sure it's reversible
(intake/exhaust). Mount the fan in, ideally, a central location with good
airflow to the rest of your house/apartment but that you don't need to be at
maximum coolness. I put mine in the dining room.
</li>

<li>
Set your fan(s) to exhaust mode (pushing air out the window) unless there are
special circumstances. The fan then creates a vacuum indoors and your airflow
will come from all windows you have open, so you can for instance open a larger
proportion of windows in a space that more urgently needs cooling, and you get a
nice breeze near any open window. If you set the fan to intake mode, then the
cool air only comes in at that specific point in the house, and you have much
less control.
</li>

<li>
To make it easy to know when to open or close the windows, find a couple of
indoor thermometers, plus an indoor/outdoor one or just a good weather app. You
can do perfectly OK just using your own senses, but it's faster and easier when
you can compare numbers. I've toyed with getting some internet-connected
sensors so I can get a push notification when it's time to open the windows, but
it looks too complicated to be fun.
</li>

<li>
When you first open the windows and turn on the fan in the evening, the
crossbreeze makes it instantly feel five degrees cooler, so you get an extra
boost. If you're uncomfortable in the early evening, you can sacrifice a little
bit of efficiency and open up before the temperature has quite equalized; there
will still be plenty of time for things to cool off overnight.
</li>

<li>
If I find it's still a touch too hot to sleep as I get ready for bed, I shut the
door and turn on the window AC unit in my bedroom 15–30 minutes before bedtime,
while leaving the rest of the apartment to cool naturally. The compressor barely
has to run at all to cool a 150-square-foot space by the amount that's still
needed, especially with the outside temperature dropping precipitously at that
point, so I'll set the thermostat to something luxurious like 70 degrees. I'll
be perfectly comfortable all night, and everything else will be a nice
temperature in the morning, too.
</li>

<li>
When the sun starts shining directly through any window, close the blinds to
prevent it from radiantly heating you and your furniture. Then open any that the
sun has moved away from. You could technically save more cool by keeping
<em>all</em> the blinds closed during the day, but then you wouldn't have any
natural light! I'm not so cheap I'll sacrifice my quality of life for two
dollars in AC use. (That said, if you're not home, it's worth
keeping everything shut unless your pets or houseplants want the light.)
</li>
</ul>

.Using this protocol, on days with highs in the eighties here, it usually
doesn't get uncomfortably warm inside until four or five in the afternoon even
with still air, and then switching on a fan pointed at my desk or couch will
keep me comfortable until evening. I rarely start to need the AC until it hits
the nineties, or if the nighttime temperature doesn't fall below 70 for a couple
nights in a row, making it hard to store enough cool for the afternoon.

.David Cain
<a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2023/05/10-things-i-want-to-communicate-to-the-human-species-before-i-die/">points out</a>
that this word is properly pronounced with a long I, /laɪvd/, to rhyme with
<em>dived</em>. This has been corrupted because <em>lived</em> with a short I is
a common word – the past tense of the verb <em>to live</em>. But if you stop to
think about it, this makes no sense semantically. The word <em>short-lived</em>
doesn't mean that something “lived shortly”, but that it had a life which was
short. It's not formed from the verb <em>to live</em> at all, but from the noun
<em>life</em> (plural <em>lives</em>, adjectival form <em>lived</em> with a long
I).

.By comparison, if a cutlery set has eight knives, you could say it's
<em>eight-knived</em>; that doesn't mean that it has stabbed someone with a
knife eight times (past tense of <em>to knife</em>, which, anytime I've ever
heard it, would actually be rendered <em>knifed</em>). Or consider a playground
with a lot of slides. This is a <em>many-slided playground</em> – surely not a
<em>*many-slid playground</em>!

.That said, I've never heard a single person say it this way; it's a losing
battle.

.(Just to make things more confusing, <em>well-lived</em> is properly pronounced
with a short I, because here <em>well</em> is an adverb describing how the act of
living was done, rather than an adjective describing the life, as in
<em>short-lived</em>; you're not talking about a life that is “well”.)

    :shortdes: The case of the missing 21st and 23rd Streets
    :tags: Minneapolis

.Living in Uptown Minneapolis, I've often been puzzled by this:

<img width="100%" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/21st-1.png" alt="Map of Lowry Hill East and Whittier, with east-west streets marked.">

.Pretend Franklin Avenue is labeled “20th St,” as you learn to do if you live
here for any length of time, and you'll see that the streets are equally spaced
(an eighth of a mile apart), but 21st and 23rd are missing from the series.

<div class="callout">
    Why isn't it Franklin <em>Street</em>, since Avenues normally go north-south
    and Streets go east-west in Minneapolis? I haven't been able to figure this one
    out. Usually when one appears to be named incorrectly, it's because it goes
    through a ninety-degree turn at some point, like Washington Avenue, which runs
    parallel to the streets downtown but goes north-south in North Minneapolis, or
    Hennepin Avenue, which runs east-west in Northeast but goes north-south in
    downtown and South Minneapolis. But Franklin doesn't make any turns anywhere
    until it merges with University Ave in St. Paul, unless you count a tiny little dip
    it does at the very west end to avoid the tip of the “finger” of Lake of the Isles.

    This is part of the act described below, but they don't explain why:

    <img width="400" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/21st-4.png" alt="That Franklin street and Grape street shall be known and designated as Franklin avenue.">

    A really irritating fact is that in most of St. Paul, Avenues run east-west
    and Streets run north-south, exactly the opposite of Minneapolis. I don't
    think this has anything to do with it, but you never know.
</div>

.I was able to find
<a href="https://www.minnpost.com/stroll/2016/01/1873-one-fell-swoop-legions-minneapolis-streets-get-new-names-or-numbers/">this MinnPost article</a>,
which explains a good chunk of the puzzle. The streets were not numbered at all
until 1873, when an act was passed that attempted to normalize all the names – a
tricky undertaking, since the area around Minneapolis had grown pretty
haphazardly and there were adjacent communities that used the same street names.
The key is this:

<blockquote>
    “I don’t know where I live now,” complained a man named “Pushit” to the
    Minneapolis Tribune before the new nomenclature took effect, “but a friend of
    mine knows where he lives. He formerly lived on Grape Street, but now he lives
    on Ninth Street west, and the next street to him is Twenty-First Street west.”
    This particular friend’s confusing new address came into being because when
    Grape became Franklin, Franklin also took the place of a 20th Street 10 blocks
    north of Lake Street, or 30th, and the streets on either side were forced to
    follow that system, however imperfectly. These were called “adjusters.” The
    greatest evidence of these “adjusters” today is that, except for a few odd
    stretches in Phillips, there are no 21st or 23rd Streets in South Minneapolis.
    Those two were dropped because there were only eight blocks between Franklin
    and Lake, where ten were required to make the system work.
</blockquote>

.The need for this “adjuster” is most obvious today when you look on the map at
how downtown, where the streets are twisted about 35 degrees from the cardinal
directions to align with the riverfront, transitions into South Minneapolis,
where the streets are a strict, evenly spaced north-south-east-west grid. It's a
little harder to see how this works nowadays since the construction of I-35W
left breaks in many of the streets there, but it's still visible:

<img width="100%" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/21st-2.png" alt="Map of downtown and the north edge of South Minneapolis.">

.Since these streets have to make a turn to align with the new shape of the grid
as they proceed south, geometry forces the realigned streets further east to
have lower numbers at the same latitude if the same number is maintained for the
entire length of the street.

.You might conclude from this that Minneapolis is unusually poorly suited to
numbered streets, but actually this weirdness is remarkably invisible unless you
live in one of the neighborhoods right next to a discontinuity (like Pushit's
friend above, or Cedar-Riverside today; even Cedar-Riverside is probably less
confusing than you might think since it's penned in by highways and the area
across a highway feels discontinuous anyway). They did a surprisingly good job,
and I think the “south of Franklin Street, restart at 21st Street” (er, “skip
21st Street and restart at 22nd Street”) maneuver is a big part of the reason it
succeeds.

.What's still not entirely clear to me is exactly why Lake Street was indexed to
30th Street, rather than 28th Street, which is what results in the missing
blocks; once you're south of Franklin Street there are no more angled streets to
screw up the numbering, and there are the same number of streets all the way
across. The article claims that Franklin Street took the place of a 20th Street
“10 blocks north of Lake Street,” but as they momentarily point out, there just
aren't 10 blocks in between old 20th Street/new Franklin Street and Lake Street,
there are 8! Maybe the streets were already numbered (incorrectly for the new
sequence) in that section? Or they wanted Lake Street to be a round number? Or
there were additional streets somewhere that figured into the calculation in
1873 that no longer exist today? Lake Street isn't mentioned at all in the
source material; I think it was outside of city limits at the time.

.In Ventura Village, 21st Street and 23rd Street get a little cameo, cutting
through the middle of the eighth-mile-block pattern:

.I don't know if these existed at the time. They're oddballs since they show up
at halfway intervals – maybe they're upgraded alleys? If they did, it's possible
they had keeping these in the sequence in mind.

    :shortdes: Press-and-hold keys
    :tags: Tech

.Some of the better modern keyboard firmware comes with options to give each
key two separate actions: one when it's tapped, and one when it's held for
longer than a certain threshold value. Kinesis's firmware actually has a pretty
cruddy implementation of this that only lets you use it for certain functions
(no macros allowed, and doesn't work on letter keys) and adds latency, but I've
still found it remarkably handy. I have three of these mappings:

<ul>
    <li><strong>The left spacebar</strong>: This being a split keyboard, there are two spacebar keys which can be mapped separately. I've remapped my left spacebar to act as Backspace when tapped and Delete when held. The left thumb is one of your strongest fingers and is almost entirely unused on a standard layout (at least for most right-handed typists), and it's really nice not to have to move your whole hand to make a correction (especially if you're as sloppy a typist as I am). I did find after enabling this that I actually hit the spacebar with my left hand much more often than I thought I did, usually when I have my hand on the mouse (for example, to scroll down on a web page, or to add a missing word space after moving the cursor with the mouse), so I remapped Fn+Spacebar to activate the actual space; now I can still get the effect of a space with one hand by dropping my thumb and pinky into position. There is also the minor annoyance that you can't hold down Backspace to backspace a bunch of letters, but in most cases I use Ctrl+Backspace (or some vim magic if available) if I need to delete a lot of text, so I haven't found this as annoying as I expected. (You could also use the standard Backspace key for this. I wound up remapping mine to toggle between virtual desktops instead because I didn't use this feature enough.)</li>
    <li><strong>The Enter key</strong>: Tapping sends Enter, holding sends Ctrl+Enter. Ctrl+Enter is like a “stronger Enter” in a lot of applications (for instance, it often sends the message in chat or comment fields that accept Enter to create a new line), and I use it a ton, so it's convenient to be able to type it with one finger.</li>
    <li><strong>The Tab key</strong>: Tapping sends Tab, holding sends Escape. Since I use vim or vim mode all over the place, having a way to press Escape without moving my hand significantly is delightful.</li>
</ul>

.If you've never used this feature before, know that you need to spend a while
tuning the threshold for how many milliseconds you have to hold down the key
before it switches to the “hold” action; the right value will depend on how
fast you type and the exact finger motions you use for each key. If you set it
too high, activating the hold action will slow you down (and if you have crappy
firmware like me, your keystrokes will all be visibly delayed). If you set it
too low, you'll accidentally activate the hold action when you mean to activate
the tap action, which is irritating at best and dangerous at worst (e.g.,
sending an unfinished message instead of adding a new line can be disastrous!).

    :tags: Tech

.I'm a huge fan of the <a
href="https://www.cherrymx.de/en/cherry-mx/mx-original/mx-blue.html">Cherry MX
Blue</a> mechanical keyboard switches for general typing; they have a low
enough activation force to feel very easy to type on but high enough that you
can rest your hands on the keyboard without pushing them accidentally, and they
make a delightful clicky noise that makes it easy to tell whether you've
activated the key or not, as well as making you sound like you're working.

.They are pretty noisy, though. I only use this keyboard in my apartment, so
there's nobody to bother…but I've recently noticed that they regularly trigger
the mute warning in video call software when I start typing in the middle of a
call, sometimes with a passive-aggressive message like “Are you talking?” This
is actually really annoying because it often steals the focus from the window
where I'm typing and I have to go manually click in the appropriate field
again!

I did an informal study on my 13 years of Anki spaced-repetition history to
settle a team question at RemNote: is our “Anki SM-2” algorithm (and Anki’s
SM-2 algorithm itself) too aggressive when scheduling overdue cards? Somewhat
to my surprise, and also to my embarrassment because I’ve been defending the
current behavior without data for many years, the answer appears to be yes;
more specifically, the more overdue a card is, the more it overestimates how
much of a bonus that should give the card's interval.

    :shortdes: Nuances of the present perfect tense
    :tags: Language

.I had a discussion with a colleague who's not a native English speaker some
months ago about the perfect tense and realized that I had actually had the
wrong impression of the distinction. The line I took exception to in what he
had asked me to read for style was something to the effect of, “We worked hard
for the last two months to bring you this update.” I pointed out that it should
be “we have worked” (or maybe continuous, “we have been working”), and I said
this was because “it's complete.”

.He asked, “But wouldn't that mean we aren't going to work hard anymore?”

.The answer to that, of course, is no, that's just not the impression a native
speaker gets from that sentence, but I couldn't square that fact with my
explanation, so I spent my next two showers thinking about this, and I realized
that my explanation was completely wrong. The distinction isn't about whether
the action is “complete” per se, but whether it <em>continues uninterrupted
through the present moment</em>. (If anything, I was backwards – the simple past
is arguably more complete than the present perfect since its action does not
continue through the present.) I came up with two interesting examples
demonstrating this.
<br><br>

.<strong>(A) Life and death: correct tense is mutually exclusive.</strong>

<ol>
    <li>
        <em>I have lived for 27 years.</em>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: green;">Correct</span>:
            So far 27 years of living have elapsed for me,
            and I am still living at the present moment.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <em>*I lived for 27 years.</em>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Wrong</span>: This statement is semantically invalid
               in any plausible world except the afterlife,
               because it implies the action does not continue through the present,
               and thus that I'm now dead.
        (It would be semantically valid to say instead,
         “I lived in the United States for 27 years”;
         this is different because one can cease to live in a place and still make statements.
         But this would be factually incorrect for me
         because I have always lived in the United States and still do.
         I could <em>also</em> say “I have lived in the United States for 27 years”; see (B).)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <em>Mozart lived for 35 years</em> (viz., from 1756–91).

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: green;">Correct</span>: This is a true statement and grammatically correct.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <em>Mozart has lived for 35 years.</em>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Wrong</span>: This statement, while grammatically and semantically acceptable,
               is factually incorrect,
               because it implies that Mozart is still living
               and the 35 years under discussion are an uninterrupted range ending in 2023,
               while in fact Mozart died about 230 years ago.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <em>Mozart has been dead for 232 years.</em>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: green;">Correct</span>: This is a true statement and grammatically correct.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <em>*Mozart was dead for 232 years.</em>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Wrong</span>:
               Semantically invalid because this implies that he came back to life at some subsequent point;
               either he's still alive now, or he was briefly resurrected and then he died again.
               (Because death is permanent, it always continues until the present time
                and thus requires the perfect tense.)</p>
    </li>
</ol>

.<strong>(B) Relationships: both simple past and present perfect are correct, but have completely different meanings.</strong>

<ol>
    <li>
        <em>Alice and I have been together for two years.</em>

        <p>This means we're still dating:
            that is, the statement also applies today
            and has not stopped applying since the beginning of the two years.
        (I could probably still say this if we had broken up and gotten back together,
         but only if it was a relatively short period of time.)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <em>Alice and I were together for two years.</em>

        <p>This means we broke up (or she died).
            That might have happened yesterday or 40 years ago,
            but it was necessarily prior to today,
            and some period in which we weren't together has intervened.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

.Because both (1) and (2) are acceptable, just with different meanings,
you can even combine them if the situation warrants:

<ol start="3">
    <li>
        <em>Alice and I were together for two years.
            Then we broke up over a disagreement about cheesecake.
            After a couple of months, we realized what a stupid mistake that was.
            Now we've been together for another year, and we're getting married next month.
        </em>

        <p>(Hey, we need a happy ending after all these deaths.)</p>
    </li>
</ol>

Since this feed seems to have become a purveyor of contraception information
for no apparent reason (previously: <a href="#post-27">#27</a>, <a
href="#post-12">#12</a>, <a href="#post-2">#2</a>), two mildly outrageous
things you probably didn't know about Plan B, the most popular version of the
“morning-after pill” in the US:

<ol>

    <li>A dose typically costs $40–50…for a single pill containing 1.5 mg of
    levonorgestrel (the amount in a few standard birth-control pills) in a box
    with some instructions. The raw materials can't possibly cost more than $5,
    but as with everything in healthcare, the market is screwy and
    manufacturers can charge people stupid amounts of money for being unlucky
    enough to need basic healthcare. (The article points out that people are
    understandably unwilling to buy generics here; emergency contraception
    doesn't seem like something to take a risk on! But the generics aren't much
    cheaper anyway.)</li>

    <li>For years, the packaging has contained a line indicating that Plan B
    may prevent implantation of a fertilized egg...but there's never actually
    been any evidence this was the case. Instead, the manufacturer added it in
    a short-sighted political move to appease people who either didn't want it
    on the market for moral reasons or argued that if there was even an
    impossibly small chance it could happen, then it was causing abortions and
    should be prohibited (since then, further research has improved the case
    that it does not). Now many of even the most sex-positive and
    pro-contraceptive people believe it actually does this. Sigh. (<a
    href="https://philpapers.org/archive/CHODFV.pdf">Dense but very interesting
    paper</a> on the history and ethics of this whole thing.) </li>

</ol>

Incidentally, in case you ever need to know for yourself or anyone else, as of
2013 anybody can walk into a US pharmacy and buy Plan B over-the-counter
without ID or consultation or any other hoops, regardless of gender or age.

.I was recently reminded that I was in college when I realized that when you
hold hands, there are two distinct orientations and one person has to go
“under” and the other has to go “over.” Somehow, every previous time I had held
hands in my life – which I don't think was something I did unusually
uncommonly – I had gone “under” and the person I was holding hands with had
either naturally started “over,” or adjusted without saying anything or making
enough of a deal about it that I noticed.

.It's fascinating to me how there are just so many random things to know in
life, which you don't learn automatically and which are so specific and
everyday that nobody writes them down or tries to teach them to you, and
because of that you can just completely miss one for years and years.

.Last Saturday, I was busy at home all day, and when I stepped out to take out
my trash and go for a walk at around 4:00 in the afternoon, I noticed that my
car wasn't in its spot. That's pretty strange, I thought, where would I have
left it? It wasn't until I thought for a few more moments that I realized it
couldn't possibly have been me being an idiot and forgetting where I parked, as
it normally is; I'd gotten home after midnight and gone right into my apartment
and not left it since, and there was no conceivable reason I would have parked
anywhere other than in my assigned spot. I hadn't been drinking or anything,
and I knew I'd driven home.

.My upstairs neighbor still had a key from when I was in San Francisco earlier
this year (so she could move my car out of the way of the plows as needed), so
I texted her to ask if she'd moved it for some reason, but she definitely
hadn't. And there was no reason I would have been towed, and no tracks in the
fresh snow from a tow truck. Which seemingly left only the possibility it had
been stolen. This was all but confirmed when I noticed that two of my car's
floor mats had been left on the ground; obviously a tow driver wouldn't have
broken into my car and thrown out the floor mats before taking it!

.After a frustrating 20 minutes of trying to find a non-emergency number that
was open over the weekend, I went ahead and called 911 and reported it stolen.
They took the details over the phone and someone from the police department
came out basically promptly (they were a few minutes later than expected, but
who isn't?) and was very nice and helpful.

.Not only that, but they actually found my car Monday morning and brought it
into the impound lot. Granted, they didn't have a very hard time; whoever stole
it had abandoned it in the middle of the lane during rush hour at 50th and
Xerxes (a major intersection in SW Minneapolis).

.On Thursday I spent a couple of hours cleaning out all the junk they left in
the car, which included, along with a bunch of trash and random items,
somewhere around eight used needles (they helpfully provided a portable sharps
container in the back seat, although it would have been rather more helpful had
they actually put the sharps <em>in</em> the sharps container; I guess that
would have made too much sense). There were also a bunch of spilled blueberries
on the floor, which doesn't exactly strike me as common junkie food! The car is
still at the body shop getting an inspection, a new bumper, and a thorough
cleaning, but it got away without much damage for a stolen car and I'll
hopefully have it back in a few days.

.Surprisingly, they didn't actually steal anything that was inside the car
except for my dashcam (unsurprisingly; you'd have to be pretty dumb to leave a
live dashcam in a stolen car), the spare key I'd left inside the car by mistake
(obviously how they stole it; I must have inadvertently left the door unlocked
as well, on the day that this person decided to wander to the back of my
apartment building and try the doors on the parked cars, setting up a perfect
storm), and, bizarrely, my car's proof of registration and insurance. They
didn't even take the cash I'd left inside.

.Anyway, my faith that the Minneapolis Police Department isn't completely
useless was slightly restored! Of course, it <s>probably</s><a

unusual number of freeze-thaw cycles (to give you an idea of how bad it is, a
friend told me they saw a driver in front of them run over a pothole on the
I-94 onramp at Hennepin Avenue that gave such a big jolt that <em>the airbags

someone noted that damage at the intersection of Lake Street and Hennepin
Avenue had actually exposed the old tracks and brick roadbed that had been
paved over, so I took a little detour over there when I walked down to the bank
today, and sure enough:

    :tags: AI | Music

.A bluesy song I'm learning includes the following progression in the key of D
major:

<blockquote>
D – F#7 – G – D – A – D
</blockquote>

.(Actually, I added the seventh because it sounded better with the mandolin's
sometimes-awkward voicing; it was a bare F# major in my source.)

.I wasn't, and am still not, sure how to describe the function of the F#
dominant seventh. When you play it, you can hear that it plainly leads into the
G, which makes some sense to me given that it's built on the seventh scale
degree of G and thus acts sort of like a V7/V (D7) would, but I can't quite put
a name on it. (I initially suspected <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritone_substitution">tritone
substitution</a>, but the relationship is off by a whole step.) In a major key,
it doesn't make sense to talk about the seventh scale degree being major, so it
must be getting borrowed from some other scale or have some funky name or
principle all its own. Please enlighten me if you know!

.Anyhow, as part of my search, I decided to see how ChatGPT would do at chord
analysis. Here's what I got:

<img loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/chord-analysis-1.png" alt="ChatGPT's first response">

.This actually wasn't a horribly bad first attempt; my initial prediction
before looking at the notes was also that the chord was a V/V or something
similar. But when I pointed out that this couldn't be correct because the V in
D major is A, and F# is separated from A by a major sixth, it produced this

    :shortdes: Temperature-based food preferences
    :tags: Life | Personal

.For my whole life, I have strongly disliked iced tea.
This wouldn't be particularly weird, except that I love hot tea
    and drink probably 4–6 cups on a typical day.
Iced tea, even high-quality brewed iced tea,
    tastes gross and bitter and sometimes even makes me gag.

.I think there might be something funny going on here
    where most people's perception of tea strength
    scales differently based on temperature than mine.
Ordinarily people brew iced tea around twice as strong as hot tea
    because tastes are perceived more weakly when food is cold.
Maybe I should try some iced-tea brewing experiments
    at different intermediate strengths
    and see if it ever starts tasting good?

.Possibly related: I dislike hot drinks that contain alcohol
    even though I like most cold or room-temperature alcoholic beverages,
    including strong spirits –
    the alcohol taste feels quite overpowering in hot drinks.
I'm not sure how this fits into that picture, though,
    since the iced tea/hot tea divide would suggest
    that I notice temperature-based strength differences
    <em>less</em> than the average person,
    while this would seemingly suggest <em>more</em>.

    :shortdes: Stupid cold hand dryers
    :tags: Life | Science

.Ever wonder why hand dryers take such a long time to warm up? Turns
out…<em>they don't</em>, as xkcd <a href="https://xkcd.com/2743/">pointed
out</a> this week. Hand dryers work by encouraging the water to evaporate from
your hands. When water evaporates off something, it cools rapidly – think about
what happens when you climb out of a bath or pool. (This is also how both
sweating and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporative_cooler">swamp
coolers</a> dissipate heat.) In the case of hand dryers, this cooling effect is
strong enough to make the jet feel cold even though it's actually quite hot –
until your hands are nearly dry, just in time to make you grumble about how it
only managed to get nice and hot when you were already done drying your hands.

.I still didn't quite believe this, but you can try this one at home! Grab a
hair dryer, set it down sideways on a flat surface with something behind it to
prevent it from jet-propelling itself across the table (or, better yet, enlist
a fellow householder to hold it, then switch places and enlighten them with
this demo), and get just one of your hands wet. Then switch it on at the
highest and hottest setting. Sure enough, mine reaches full power – hot enough
to be painful on a closely placed dry hand – within 5 seconds after a cold
start, yet still feels cold on the wet hand.

.Come to think of it, I've been low-grade puzzled for years about why my hair
dryer only <em>sometimes</em> seems to take forever to heat up. Once you know
all this, of course, the answer is as blatantly obvious as it was mysterious
before: sometimes my hair is wetter when I start drying it, which makes it feel
colder for longer.

.I'm sure some of y'all think this is obvious and are laughing at the rest of
us now, to which I can only say, this xkcd appears to be autobiographical, and
if Randall Monroe, a former NASA engineer and author of bestselling silly
physics books, only recently figured this out, it can't be <em>that</em>
obvious, can it?

    :tags: AI | Research | Tech

.<a href="https://metaphor.systems">Metaphor</a> is an experimental new kind of
search engine based on an LLM. Rather than typing in keywords describing what
you're looking for, you pretend you already have the link you want and are
sending it to a friend, and write a brief introduction explaining what it is.
Then it supplies a list of predictions for what link you might be talking about.

.This works surprisingly well. I find it especially useful if I am thinking of an
article I know exists somewhere on the web, but can't remember what it was
called; it's challenging to find effective keywords for a traditional search
engine in this case, but usually easy to describe the article in enough detail
that Metaphor can find it.

    :shortdes: What the heck is TiddlyWiki, actually?
    :tags: Learning | Tech

.The other day I was on a first date
    and we were talking about our experiences of the early COVID-19 pandemic,
    and I mentioned that I had used much of my excessive free time to write
    a textbook called <a href="https://groktiddlywiki.com">Grok TiddlyWiki</a>.
Naturally, she asked what TiddlyWiki was,
    and I realized, somewhat to my alarm, that I had no effective way to explain it.
If anyone in the entire world
    should be able to give a good elevator pitch for TiddlyWiki,
    surely it ought to be me,
    seeing as I recently spent a year and a half writing a book to teach people how to use it!
My first reach was “<a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a>, but more customizable,”
    but she hadn't heard of Notion,
    so that didn't help at all,
    and this seems like a cop-out anyway;
    it just moves the question to, what the heck is Notion, actually?

.Once you get over the immediate absurdity of the fact that
    I just wrote a book about this tool and I still can't concisely explain what it is,
    that this is challenging isn't actually all that surprising:
    a general problem with researching, developing, and promoting
    tools for thought like TiddlyWiki
    is that they
    <a href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#ToolsForThinkingDontWow">don't wow</a>.
That is, because the really revolutionary ones allow you to think in new ways,
    the problem of understanding why the tool is useful
    and the problem of learning the tool
    are necessarily intertwined;
    without the habits of thought developed by learning and using the tool,
    the tool in some way <em>can't</em> make sense.
(Paul Graham popularized this line of thought back in 2001
 when he wrote about <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">Blub programmers</a>.)

.This said, surely I can at least do better than “Notion, but more customizable.”
A good start is the front page of <em>Grok</em> itself:

<blockquote>
TiddlyWiki is a human-shaped tool for organizing information and taking notes. It stores and relates information in a non-linear but structured way, just like your brain, and it doesn't forget things.
</blockquote>

.It's helpful to add some use cases, like I do a bit lower down:

<blockquote>
People use TiddlyWiki for keeping notes at their jobs, collecting their ideas, keeping track of what they read, drafting books, building static websites, storing recipes, managing genealogical databases, planning tabletop role-playing campaigns, and much more.
</blockquote>

.The big problem here is that, reading this description,
    you still don't know anything
    about <em>how</em> one uses TiddlyWiki to do this.
This is not really a problem for <em>Grok TiddlyWiki</em>,
    since the entire rest of the book is about this,
    but it's a big problem if you're trying to educate and/or hook
    people who aren't already interested.
It's like we've explained what a car is
    but not talked about how one uses the steering wheel
    and pedals to make it move around.
If you've never heard of a car or seen someone drive one,
    it's going to be tough to imagine someone using one without those details,
    and I find it's difficult to understand the value or purpose of software
    if you can't imagine the experience of using it.

.Here's my best shot at a version that incorporates most of the ideas above.
It starts by comparing to a tool almost everyone will know,
    but doesn't rely on that comparison;
    it incorporates the “human-shaped” idea
    and the example use cases,
    and it tries to give a picture of the actions one takes
    when working with a TiddlyWiki.
Its biggest weakness is that it tends on the formal and dense side.
I feel like I should be spending many more days on this problem;
    it's hard to imagine how the field of tools for thought in general
    is going to succeed unless we find a way to explain why it's important!

<hr>

.<strong>TiddlyWiki</strong> is a tool that helps you think in new ways
    by extending the fundamental ideas of the spreadsheet
    so that they work effectively with long-form prose.
Information in TiddlyWiki has a flexible structure,
    so you can match the shape of your content within the wiki
    to the way you think about it.
Things can be organized strictly,
    in tables like a spreadsheet
        or in hierarchies like an outline,
    or loosely, in webs of related components with nebulous relationships,
    and you can show the same data in different formats at different times.
You split your facts and ideas into little pieces called <em>tiddlers</em>
    (much like rows of a spreadsheet)
    and the tiddlers into fields (much like columns),
    then add links and tags to describe the relationships between tiddlers.
Then you can use custom formulas and formatting options
    to search, filter, sort,
        answer questions about the relationships between things,
        and change the appearance of your wiki to look like almost anything at all.

.The amount of flexibility TiddlyWiki affords makes it challenging to learn or even explain
    – you have to develop a few new ways of thinking to make effective use of the tool –
    so that's what my book is designed to help with.
I use my primary TiddlyWiki as a sort of topically organized journal,
    keeping track of things I've learned about myself, my life, and the world
    in a form where I can easily build on previous insights.

speed, which turned out to be 30mph gusting to 55mph. The Pacific was looking
pretty majestic, but I basically got low-pressure sandblasted as I walked
along. I also planned to take a shortcut through what looked on Google Maps
like a public park but turned out to be a heavily fenced private golf course,
and ended up having to walk along the median of a four-lane highway and then
vault over a jersey barrier to get to the beach (there wasn't too much traffic
and it felt pretty safe, but it wasn't exactly pleasant!).

    :shortdes: The Harrow and the Harvest
    :tags: Music

.Now in San Francisco for the month, this weekend I rented a car and did a road
trip north on Highway 1 to Fort Bragg, a beautiful drive. I brought with me and
listened to (multiple times) all the albums of Gillian Welch, who I recently
rediscovered. As funny as it sounds to say this since this was only five years
ago, I think I wasn't old enough to appreciate it when I heard it for the first
time, just after graduating college.

.(Although most of the music they make together is under the name “Gillian
Welch”, Welch's partner David Rawlings is as essential a part of it as she is;
they write the songs together and he plays lead guitar and sings harmony on
everything.)

.What I love about Welch and Rawlings &ndash; and the reason I think I wasn't
old enough to get it before &ndash; is that they tell the story of life just
like it is. They neither sugarcoat things nor tell unmitigated tragedies; their
songs are almost universally about suffering and loss and struggle, often
severe, and yet somewhere there's always a tinge of solace and redemption,
often so subtle and implied that you can't figure out where it comes from, but
you feel it, a testament to the fact that despite all this, people manage to
make life not just tolerable but very worth living. There are certainly no
promises, but there is hope.

.In recent years their arrangements have been sparse, usually just their voices
and two guitars, occasionally a little mandolin or banjo or percussion; it
sounds like two people sitting on their porch picking, except they're insanely
good. Musicians will know these simple arrangements are not the easiest but the
hardest to get right, because there's nowhere to hide the mistakes. But the two
of them are so perfectly in sync that there aren't any mistakes to hide. Their
voices even blend so well that sometimes I don't immediately notice Rawlings
has come in, even though he's singing different notes!

.I think their finest work so far is <em><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37u3_659fXk&list=PLnfP0ZfzDtH94lj2KojYlEe5mAKk6qCNo">The
Harrow and the Harvest</a></em>, published in 2011. The epitome of everything
I've said above is the track <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k35haKwqY14&list=PLnfP0ZfzDtH94lj2KojYlEe5mAKk6qCNo&index=6">“Hard
Times”</a>, which borrows the title from Stephen Foster but takes the sentiment
in a totally different direction. Instead of being comfortable and sparing a
thought for those worse off than them, the characters are in the thick of it,
dealing with the hard times, and they don't presume to ask for hard times to
“come again no more,” but simply promise themselves that the hard times “won't rule
their minds no more.” Yet the ploughman, very relatably, fails to take his own
advice, falling victim to modernization and ceasing his refrain, even as the
audience is exhorted to celebrate in the midst of it one more time.

.While I still don't have a clean word I like for it (but thanks to those who

    :shortdes: The remarkable compounding of small amounts of time
    :tags: Life | Statistics

.The average city dweller spends around four months of their life waiting at
red lights.

.If this sounds impossible, here's the math: suppose you average about five
minutes a day waiting at various red lights. (That's probably eight average
lights' worth of waiting? I definitely wait at more some days, but then there
are days I don't go much of anywhere since I work from home, so this seems
about right. I'd expect it to be more for people who have significant commutes.
If you take the subway or grade-separated light rail most of the time, you get
to skip most of the red lights, but then you wait for your train to arrive
instead.) That makes 1,825 minutes per year. Then we'll say you spend 60 years
of your life in the city and traveling around regularly (this is probably an
underestimate), for 109,500 total minutes spent at red lights. Divide by 60
again for hours, and by 16 for waking hours per day, and you get 114 waking
days spent waiting, or just under four months.

.Five minutes a day doesn't seem like much of a commitment. But actually it's a
<em>huge</em> one. You can get a lot done in five minutes a day if you're
<a href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#PowerOfKonsistency">consistent</a>.
You can also waste an enormous amount of time in five minutes a day if you're not
doing something worthwhile with it. (Exercise for the reader: can you do
something interesting while waiting at red lights?)

<div class="callout">

    <em>Rule of thumb</em>: 15 minutes a day is 1/60 of your time. If you spend
    15 minutes daily for a year, you will have spent 6 days (or 12 full-time
    work days) total; for 60 years, 1 year total.

</div>
