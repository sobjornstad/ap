    :title: Misinformation Clouds America’s Most Popular Emergency Contraception
    :author: KHN
    :source: https://khn.org/news/article/emergency-contraception-plan-b-private-equity-abortion-debate/
    :tags: Life

Since this feed seems to have become a purveyor of contraception information
for no apparent reason (previously: <a href="#post-27">#27</a>, <a
href="#post-12">#12</a>, <a href="#post-12">#2</a>), two mildly outrageous
things you probably didn't know about Plan B, the most popular version of the
“morning-after pill” in the US:

<ol>

    <li>A dose typically costs $40–50…for a single pill containing 1.5 mg of
    levonorgestrel (the amount in a few standard birth-control pills) in a box
    with some instructions. The raw materials can't possibly cost more than $5,
    but as with everything in healthcare, the market is screwy and
    manufacturers can charge people stupid amounts of money for being unlucky
    enough to need basic healthcare. (The article points out that people are
    understandably unwilling to buy generics here; emergency contraception
    doesn't seem like something to take a risk on! But the generics aren't much
    cheaper anyway.)</li>

    <li>For years, the packaging has contained a line indicating that Plan B
    may prevent implantation of a fertilized egg...but there's never actually
    been any evidence this was the case. Instead, the manufacturer added it in
    a short-sighted political move to appease people who either didn't want it
    on the market for moral reasons or argued that if there was even an
    impossibly small chance it could happen, then it was causing abortions and
    should be prohibited (since then, further research has improved the case
    that it does not). Now many of even the most sex-positive and
    pro-contraceptive people believe it actually does this. Sigh. (<a
    href="https://philpapers.org/archive/CHODFV.pdf">Dense but very interesting
    paper</a> on the history and ethics of this whole thing.) </li>

</ol>

Incidentally, in case you ever need to know for yourself or anyone else, as of
2013 anybody can walk into a US pharmacy and buy Plan B over-the-counter
without ID or consultation or any other hoops, regardless of gender or age.

    :tags: Life

.I was recently reminded that I was in college when I realized that when you
hold hands, there are two distinct orientations and one person has to go
“under” and the other has to go “over.” Somehow, every previous time I had held
hands in my life – which I don't think was something I did unusually
uncommonly – I had gone “under” and the person I was holding hands with had
either naturally started “over,” or adjusted without saying anything or making
enough of a deal about it that I noticed.

.It's fascinating to me how there are just so many random things to know in
life, which you don't learn automatically and which are so specific and
everyday that nobody writes them down or tries to teach them to you, and
because of that you can just completely miss one for years and years.

.As always, there is a <a href="https://xkcd.com/1053/">relevant xkcd</a>.

<em>Commodification of attention</em> is a system of organizational,
psychological, and financial innovations that enables one to make money and/or
curry favor by simply convincing people to spend time looking at things,
usually virtual ones. In this post, I explore a variety of modern problems,
especially social ones, I think COA is partially responsible for, including the
degradation of quality in web searches, many of the negative effects of social
media, smartphone addiction, and a decline in spontaneity and general freedom
of socialization, as well as how COVID plays into all of this.

.This afternoon I was trying to watch TV with a friend, and whenever she tried
to select something on Netflix to watch, the Roku app crashed and we had to
start over again. After several repetitions, she handed the remote to me,
suggesting that the TV “didn't like her” and maybe I would have better luck. I
didn't, but I realized later that at the time, I think I actually legitimately
thought this sounded like a reasonable troubleshooting step!

.As dumb as that sounds, we ended up “solving” the problem by going to Target
(which we wanted to do anyway) and coming back, then trying again. This time it
worked on the first try. It seems to me that this approach has an only
marginally larger space of reasonable causal explanations, and yet this one
worked.

.I'm not sure what the lesson here is, except that software is terrible and I
have no idea how anything ever works at all.

    :shortdes: In which the MPD does their job and I clean up blueberries left by a heroin addict
    :tags: Minneapolis | Personal

.Last Saturday, I was busy at home all day, and when I stepped out to take out
my trash and go for a walk at around 4:00 in the afternoon, I noticed that my
car wasn't in its spot. That's pretty strange, I thought, where would I have
left it? It wasn't until I thought for a few more moments that I realized it
couldn't possibly have been me being an idiot and forgetting where I parked, as
it normally is; I'd gotten home after midnight and gone right into my apartment
and not left it since, and there was no conceivable reason I would have parked
anywhere than in my assigned spot. I hadn't been drinking or anything, and I
knew I'd driven home.

.My upstairs neighbor still had a key from when I was in San Francisco earlier
this year (so she could move my car out of the way of the plows as needed), so
I texted her to ask if she'd moved it for some reason, but she definitely
hadn't. And there was no reason I would have been towed, and no tracks in the
fresh snow from a tow truck. Which seemingly left only the possibility it had
been stolen. This was all but confirmed when I noticed that two of my car's
floor mats had been left on the ground; obviously a tow driver wouldn't have
broken into my car and thrown out the floor mats before taking it!

.After a frustrating 20 minutes of trying to find a non-emergency number that
was open over the weekend, I went ahead and called 911 and reported it stolen.
They took the details over the phone and someone from the police department
came out basically promptly (they were a few minutes later than expected, but
who isn't?) and was very nice and helpful.

.Not only that, but they actually found my car Monday morning and brought it
into the impound lot. Granted, they didn't have a very hard time; whoever stole
it had abandoned it in the middle of the lane during rush hour at 50th and
Xerxes (a major intersection in SW Minneapolis).

.On Thursday I spent a couple of hours cleaning out all the junk they left in
the car, which included, along with a bunch of trash and random items,
somewhere around eight used needles (they helpfully provided a portable sharps
container in the back seat, although it would have been rather more helpful had
they actually put the sharps <em>in</em> the sharps container; I guess that
would have made too much sense). There were also a bunch of spilled blueberries
on the floor, which doesn't exactly strike me as common junkie food! The car is
still at the body shop getting an inspection, a new bumper, and a thorough
cleaning, but it got away without much damage for a stolen car and I'll
hopefully have it back in a few days.

.Surprisingly, they didn't actually steal anything that was inside the car
except for my dashcam (unsurprisingly; you'd have to be pretty dumb to leave a
live dashcam in a stolen car), the spare key I'd left inside the car by mistake
(obviously how they stole it; I must have inadvertently left the door unlocked
as well, on the day that this person decided to wander to the back of my
apartment building and try the doors on the parked cars, setting up a perfect
storm), and, bizarrely, my car's proof of registration and insurance. They
didn't even take the cash I'd left inside.

.Anyway, my faith that the Minneapolis Police Department isn't completely
useless was slightly restored! Of course, it probably helps that I'm white…

    :tags: Minneapolis

.In <a href="#post-47">#47</a>, in discussing Lowry Hill Park, I mentioned in
passing that Minneapolis used to have an extensive streetcar system that was
paved over in the mid-20th century.

.This winter has turned our roads into a mess of potholes, probably due to an
unusual number of freeze-thaw cycles (to give you an idea of how bad it is, a
friend told me they saw a driver in front of them run over a pothole on the
I-94 onramp at Hennepin Avenue that gave such a big jolt that <em>the airbags
deployed</em>). In a discussion about the roads on the Minneapolis subreddit,
someone noted that damage at the intersection of Lake Street and Hennepin
Avenue had actually exposed the old tracks and brick roadbed that had been
paved over, so I took a little detour over there when I walked down to the bank
today, and sure enough:

    :shortdes: In which ChatGPT does chord analysis not even wrong
    :tags: AI | Music

.A bluesy song I'm learning includes the following progression in the key of D
major:

<blockquote>
D – F#7 – G – D – A – D
</blockquote>

.(Actually, I added the seventh because it sounded better with the mandolin's
sometimes-awkward voicing; it was a bare F# major in my source.)

.I wasn't, and am still not, sure how to describe the function of the F#
dominant seventh. When you play it, you can hear that it plainly leads into the
G, which makes some sense to me given that it's built on the seventh scale
degree of G and thus acts sort of like a V7/V (D7) would, but I can't quite put
a name on it. (I initially suspected <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritone_substitution">tritone
substitution</a>, but the relationship is off by a whole step.) In a major key,
it doesn't make sense to talk about the seventh scale degree being major, so it
must be getting borrowed from some other scale or have some funky name or
principle all its own. Please enlighten me if you know!

.Anyhow, as part of my search, I decided to see how ChatGPT would do at chord
analysis. Here's what I got:

<img loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/chord-analysis-1.png" alt="ChatGPT's first response">

.This actually wasn't a horribly bad first attempt; my initial prediction
before looking at the notes was also that the chord was a V/V or something
similar. But when I pointed out that this couldn't be correct because the V in
D major is A, and F# is separated from A by a major sixth, it produced this
delightfully confident nonsense:

<img loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/chord-analysis-2.png" alt="ChatGPT's second response">

.10/10 on matching the form of a harmonic analysis, 0/10 on forming a logical argument.

    :shortdes: Temperature-based food preferences
    :tags: Life | Personal

.For my whole life, I have strongly disliked iced tea.
This wouldn't be particularly weird, except that I love hot tea
    and drink probably 4–6 cups on a typical day.
Iced tea, even high-quality brewed iced tea,
    tastes gross and bitter and sometimes even makes me gag.

.I think there might be something funny going on here
    where most people's perception of tea strength
    scales differently based on temperature than mine.
Ordinarily people brew iced tea around twice as strong as hot tea
    because tastes are perceived more weakly when food is cold.
Maybe I should try some iced-tea brewing experiments
    at different intermediate strengths
    and see if it ever starts tasting good?

.Possibly related: I dislike hot drinks that contain alcohol
    even though I like most cold or room-temperature alcoholic beverages,
    including strong spirits –
    the alcohol taste feels quite overpowering in hot drinks.
I'm not sure how this fits into that picture, though,
    since the iced tea/hot tea divide would suggest
    that I notice temperature-based strength differences
    <em>less</em> than the average person,
    while this would seemingly suggest <em>more</em>.

    :shortdes: Stupid cold hand dryers
    :tags: Life | Science

.Ever wonder why hand dryers take such a long time to warm up? Turns
out…<em>they don't</em>, as xkcd <a href="https://xkcd.com/2743/">pointed
out</a> this week. Hand dryers work by encouraging the water to evaporate from
your hands. When water evaporates off something, it cools rapidly – think about
what happens when you climb out of a bath or pool. (This is also how both
sweating and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporative_cooler">swamp
coolers</a> dissipate heat.) In the case of hand dryers, this cooling effect is
strong enough to make the jet feel cold even though it's actually quite hot –
until your hands are nearly dry, just in time to make you grumble about how it
only managed to get nice and hot when you were already done drying your hands.

.I still didn't quite believe this, but you can try this one at home! Grab a
hair dryer, set it down sideways on a flat surface with something behind it to
prevent it from jet-propelling itself across the table (or, better yet, enlist
a fellow householder to hold it, then switch places and enlighten them with
this demo), and get just one of your hands wet. Then switch it on at the
highest and hottest setting. Sure enough, mine reaches full power – hot enough
to be painful on a closely placed dry hand – within 5 seconds after a cold
start, yet still feels cold on the wet hand.

.Come to think of it, I've been low-grade puzzled for years about why my hair
dryer only <em>sometimes</em> seems to take forever to heat up. Once you know
all this, of course, the answer is as blatantly obvious as it was mysterious
before: sometimes my hair is wetter when I start drying it, which makes it feel
colder for longer.

.I'm sure some of y'all think this is obvious and are laughing at the rest of
us now, to which I can only say, this xkcd appears to be autobiographical, and
if Randall Monroe, a former NASA engineer and author of bestselling silly
physics books, only recently figured this out, it can't be <em>that</em>
obvious, can it?

.<a href="https://metaphor.systems">Metaphor</a> is an experimental new kind of
search engine based on an LLM. Rather than typing in keywords describing what
you're looking for, you pretend you already have the link you want and are
sending it to a friend, and write a brief introduction explaining what it is.
Then it supplies a list of predictions for what link you might be talking about.

.This works surprisingly well. I find it especially useful if I am thinking of an
article I know exists somewhere on the web, but can't remember what it was
called; it's challenging to find effective keywords for a traditional search
engine in this case, but usually easy to describe the article in enough detail
that Metaphor can find it.

    :shortdes: What the heck is TiddlyWiki, actually?
    :tags: Learning | Tech

.The other day I was on a first date
    and we were talking about our experiences of the early COVID-19 pandemic,
    and I mentioned that I had used much of my excessive free time to write
    a textbook called <a href="https://groktiddlywiki.com">Grok TiddlyWiki</a>.
Naturally, she asked what TiddlyWiki was,
    and I realized, somewhat to my alarm, that I had no effective way to explain it.
If anyone in the entire world
    should be able to give a good elevator pitch for TiddlyWiki,
    surely it ought to be me,
    seeing as I recently spent a year and a half writing a book to teach people how to use it!
My first reach was “<a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a>, but more customizable,”
    but she hadn't heard of Notion,
    so that didn't help at all,
    and this seems like a cop-out anyway;
    it just moves the question to, what the heck is Notion, actually?

.Once you get over the immediate absurdity of the fact that
    I just wrote a book about this tool and I still can't concisely explain what it is,
    that this is challenging isn't actually all that surprising:
    a general problem with researching, developing, and promoting
    tools for thought like TiddlyWiki
    is that they
    <a href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#ToolsForThinkingDontWow">don't wow</a>.
That is, because the really revolutionary ones allow you to think in new ways,
    the problem of understanding why the tool is useful
    and the problem of learning the tool
    are necessarily intertwined;
    without the habits of thought developed by learning and using the tool,
    the tool in some way <em>can't</em> make sense.
(Paul Graham popularized this line of thought back in 2001
 when he wrote about <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">Blub programmers</a>.)

.This said, surely I can at least do better than “Notion, but more customizable.”
A good start is the front page of <em>Grok</em> itself:

<blockquote>
TiddlyWiki is a human-shaped tool for organizing information and taking notes. It stores and relates information in a non-linear but structured way, just like your brain, and it doesn't forget things.
</blockquote>

.It's helpful to add some use cases, like I do a bit lower down:

<blockquote>
People use TiddlyWiki for keeping notes at their jobs, collecting their ideas, keeping track of what they read, drafting books, building static websites, storing recipes, managing genealogical databases, planning tabletop role-playing campaigns, and much more.
</blockquote>

.The big problem here is that, reading this description,
    you still don't know anything
    about <em>how</em> one uses TiddlyWiki to do this.
This is not really a problem for <em>Grok TiddlyWiki</em>,
    since the entire rest of the book is about this,
    but it's a big problem if you're trying to educate and/or hook
    people who aren't already interested.
It's like we've explained what a car is
    but not talked about how one uses the steering wheel
    and pedals to make it move around.
If you've never heard of a car or seen someone drive one,
    it's going to be tough to imagine someone using one without those details,
    and I find it's difficult to understand the value or purpose of software
    if you can't imagine the experience of using it.

.Here's my best shot at a version that incorporates most of the ideas above.
It starts by comparing to a tool almost everyone will know,
    but doesn't rely on that comparison;
    it incorporates the “human-shaped” idea
    and the example use cases,
    and it tries to give a picture of the actions one takes
    when working with a TiddlyWiki.
Its biggest weakness is that it tends on the formal and dense side.
I feel like I should be spending many more days on this problem;
    it's hard to imagine how the field of tools for thought in general
    is going to succeed unless we find a way to explain why it's important!

<hr>

.<strong>TiddlyWiki</strong> is a tool that helps you think in new ways
    by extending the fundamental ideas of the spreadsheet
    so that they work effectively with long-form prose.
Information in TiddlyWiki has a flexible structure,
    so you can match the shape of your content within the wiki
    to the way you think about it.
Things can be organized strictly,
    in tables like a spreadsheet
        or in hierarchies like an outline,
    or loosely, in webs of related components with nebulous relationships,
    and you can show the same data in different formats at different times.
You split your facts and ideas into little pieces called <em>tiddlers</em>
    (much like rows of a spreadsheet)
    and the tiddlers into fields (much like columns),
    then add links and tags to describe the relationships between tiddlers.
Then you can use custom formulas and formatting options
    to search, filter, sort,
        answer questions about the relationships between things,
        and change the appearance of your wiki to look like almost anything at all.

.The amount of flexibility TiddlyWiki affords makes it challenging to learn or even explain
    – you have to develop a few new ways of thinking to make effective use of the tool –
    so that's what my book is designed to help with.
I use my primary TiddlyWiki as a sort of topically organized journal,
    keeping track of things I've learned about myself, my life, and the world
    in a form where I can easily build on previous insights.

along. I also planned to take a shortcut through what looked on Google Maps
like a public park but turned out to be a heavily fenced private golf course,
and ended up having to walk along the median of a four-lane highway and then
vault over a jersey barrier to get to the beach (there wasn't too much traffic
and it felt pretty safe, but it wasn't exactly pleasant!).

.Now in San Francisco for the month, this weekend I rented a car and did a road
trip north on Highway 1 to Fort Bragg, a beautiful drive. I brought with me and
listened to (multiple times) all the albums of Gillian Welch, who I recently
rediscovered. As funny as it sounds to say this since this was only five years
ago, I think I wasn't old enough to appreciate it when I heard it for the first
time, just after graduating college.

.(Although most of the music they make together is under the name “Gillian
Welch”, Welch's partner David Rawlings is as essential a part of it as she is;
they write the songs together and he plays lead guitar and sings harmony on
everything.)

.What I love about Welch and Rawlings &ndash; and the reason I think I wasn't
old enough to get it before &ndash; is that they tell the story of life just
like it is. They neither sugarcoat things nor tell unmitigated tragedies; their
songs are almost universally about suffering and loss and struggle, often
severe, and yet somewhere there's always a tinge of solace and redemption,
often so subtle and implied that you can't figure out where it comes from, but
you feel it, a testament to the fact that despite all this, people manage to
make life not just tolerable but very worth living. There are certainly no
promises, but there is hope.

.In recent years their arrangements have been sparse, usually just their voices
and two guitars, occasionally a little mandolin or banjo or percussion; it
sounds like two people sitting on their porch picking, except they're insanely
good. Musicians will know these simple arrangements are not the easiest but the
hardest to get right, because there's nowhere to hide the mistakes. But the two
of them are so perfectly in sync that there aren't any mistakes to hide. Their
voices even blend so well that sometimes I don't immediately notice Rawlings
has come in, even though he's singing different notes!

.I think their finest work so far is <em><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37u3_659fXk&list=PLnfP0ZfzDtH94lj2KojYlEe5mAKk6qCNo">The
Harrow and the Harvest</a></em>, published in 2011. The epitome of everything
I've said above is the track <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k35haKwqY14&list=PLnfP0ZfzDtH94lj2KojYlEe5mAKk6qCNo&index=6">“Hard
Times”</a>, which borrows the title from Stephen Foster but takes the sentiment
in a totally different direction. Instead of being comfortable and sparing a
thought for those worse off than them, the characters are in the thick of it,
dealing with the hard times, and they don't presume to ask for hard times to
“come again no more,” but simply promise themselves that the hard times “won't rule
their minds no more.” Yet the ploughman, very relatably, fails to take his own
advice, falling victim to modernization and ceasing his refrain, even as the
audience is exhorted to celebrate in the midst of it one more time.

.In <a href="#post-11">#11</a>, I was searching for terminology related to:

<blockquote>
    ...a pattern I've started noticing, in which someone wants to achieve a
    particular goal A, or likes a particular process or activity in total, but is
    incapable of, scared of, or strongly dislikes a necessary component or step of
    that goal/process/activity A&prime;, creating an infuriating tension and an
    obstacle to progress.
</blockquote>

.While I still don't have a clean word I like for it (but thanks to those who
have sent suggestions and interesting notes!), I noticed that David Cain has
the following enlightening diagram describing more or less this phenomenon in
his “<a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2015/04/freedom-comes-from-how-you-live/">How
Mindfulness Creates Freedom</a>”:

.The greener an area, the more desirable it is. Sometimes, to get to the green A
territory, you have to pass through some less-green A' territory.

    :shortdes: A way to describe being happy to do something only if others want to do it
    :tags: Language | Society

.<em>Situation</em> (based on a true story): Three friends, Alice, Bob, and
Charlie, are planning on meeting up, but there is heavy snow. Alice writes to
say she can't make it because her street hasn't been plowed yet and her car
doesn't have enough clearance to drive through the snow. Bob and Charlie thus
learn the roads are probably going to be a real pain to venture out on, and
Alice can't make it, so they start to consider canceling, but aren't sure. Bob
thinks he would enjoy going if Charlie still actively wants to meet up, but
doesn't want to bother if they both feel this way.

.Is there a concise way to describe Bob's attitude?

.Near misses:

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox">Abilene paradox</a>:
        In this one, everyone actively believes they would prefer not to go,
        and agrees only because they (wrongly) believe others want to.
        In my example, Bob believes he would legitimately enjoy going
        as long as Charlie really wants to be there.

        <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/the-misunderstood-science-of-sexual-desire.html">Responsive desire</a> (mildly NSFW):
        Too specific and doesn't quite capture
        the dependence on another person's attitude.

    :shortdes: The remarkable compounding of small amounts of time
    :tags: Life | Statistics

.The average city dweller spends around four months of their life waiting at
red lights.

.If this sounds impossible, here's the math: suppose you average about five
minutes a day waiting at various red lights. (That's probably eight average
lights' worth of waiting? I definitely wait at more some days, but then there
are days I don't go much of anywhere since I work from home, so this seems
about right. I'd expect it to be more for people who have significant commutes.
If you take the subway or grade-separated light rail most of the time, you get
to skip most of the red lights, but then you wait for your train to arrive
instead.) That makes 1,825 minutes per year. Then we'll say you spend 60 years
of your life in the city and traveling around regularly (this is probably an
underestimate), for 109,500 total minutes spent at red lights. Divide by 60
again for hours, and by 16 for waking hours per day, and you get 114 waking
days spent waiting, or just under four months.

.Five minutes a day doesn't seem like much of a commitment. But actually it's a
<em>huge</em> one. You can get a lot done in five minutes a day if you're
<a href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#PowerOfKonsistency">consistent</a>.
You can also waste an enormous amount of time in five minutes a day if you're not
doing something worthwhile with it. (Exercise for the reader: can you do
something interesting while waiting at red lights?)

<div class="callout">

    <em>Rule of thumb</em>: 15 minutes a day is 1/60 of your time. If you spend
    15 minutes daily for a year, you will have spent 6 days (or 12 full-time
    work days) total; for 60 years, 1 year total.
