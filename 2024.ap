    :title: In What Sense is AI Poetry Indistinguishable from Human Poetry? (Not the One You Think)
    :source: https://controlaltbackspace.org/ai-poetry/
    :tags: AI | Tech

Recent study headline claims that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-76900-1">AI-generated poetry is indistinguishable from human-written poetry and is rated more favorably</a>. But I tried distinguishing the poems in their study and got 84 out of 87 correct.
</p><p>

I think what the study really shows is that people quickly taking a survey who probably don’t have much familiarity with AI poetry, are somewhat confused as to the nature of the task, start with misleading (but easily correctable) heuristics, and have never tried a similar task before, often are fooled into mixing up human and AI poetry, at least on their first trial. This is an interesting result, to be sure, but it has very different implications from the headline. It certainly does not mean that AI poetry is at the level of famous human poetry and can be substituted for it (even the original article doesn’t make this claim, but the title makes it sound like it does).

    :shortdes: Design Hall of Shame: Upside-down lightbulbs
    :tags: Design

.I needed some replacement bulbs for my piano light and bought a package on
Amazon. When it arrived and I put it on the counter, it looked like this:

<img class="center" width="500px" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/upside-down-lightbulbs-2.jpg">

.A little weird that the tab is on the bottom instead of the top of the
package, but oh well, whatever, right? I opened it and...

<img class="center" width="500px" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/upside-down-lightbulbs-1.jpg">

.Yep, the lightbulbs are in the box upside down when you open it, so that in
order to get one of the bulbs out, I had to pull up the loose piece of
cardboard with the holes in it and have all the bulbs fall out into the bottom
of the box.

.It turns out that the box opens on both sides with identical tab closures,
and the orientation you're supposed to open it in to avoid this happening is
this one:

<img class="center" width="500px" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/upside-down-lightbulbs-3.jpg">

.Not that there is any indication of this whatsoever.

    :shortdes: XY Problem
    :tags: Humor | Story | Tech

.The <a href="https://xyproblem.info">XY problem</a> is when you aren't sure
how to solve a problem, work on it yourself for a while, get stuck, and ask for
help, but instead of asking for help with your original problem, you ask for
help with one of your attempted <em>solutions</em>. This often turns out to be
a confusing waste of time, because the fact that you haven't managed to solve
the problem yet suggests there is something about it that you still don't fully
understand, and your attempted solution might be a complete dead end.

.One of my favorite examples occurred when I was working at the helpdesk at my
college. Someone came up to the desk and asked if I could teach him how to scan
a document from the campus copiers. Sure, no problem. We went to the nearest
copier and I walked him through putting the document in the feeder, logging in
to the copier, selecting the scan options, and choosing it to email it to
himself. He seemed to understand everything, and five minutes or so later he
had successfully sent the document to his campus email. Then:

<p>
<div><em>Him</em>: “Now, how can I print it?”</div>
<div><em>Me</em>: “You mean you want to…copy the document? From the copier?”</div>
</p>

.Needless to say, copying a document from the copier is a one-button-press
affair!

    :shortdes: What percentage of people have ever been on an airplane?
    :tags: Travel | Statistics

.This is apparently a very hard question to answer. (I guess this makes sense –
the proportion will be totally different for every country because of both
geography and wealth, and surveying the whole world accurately is rather
difficult. Also, there's not a whole lot of reason to know except curiosity.)

.The closest thing to a consensus I could find was about 20% of the world
population, but on further investigation, this appears to trace back to a
random out-of-context quotation by the CEO of Boeing in 2017, and he actually
said “less than 20%” (he was discussing how Boeing still has a large potential
market). Claude quoted both “5–11%” and “20%” in the same response in pure LLM
mode, and 20% when it searched the web.

.The person who got me thinking about this claimed it was under 10%, and while
I didn't think this sounded all that far off, I was suspicious it might be out
of date, because of this hockey stick:

<img class="center" width="800px" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/global-flights.png">

<div class="callout">
<strong>Off topic:</strong> Can we all take a moment to appreciate how reliably the
graph of global passenger-flights momentarily plateaus every time there's a
recession in the USA? (Plus of course the literally world-stopping drop in
2020.)
</div>

.Gut check: if it's ~20%, that's an average of 2.8 flights per person who has
ever flown per year. But that's more like one round trip per year because this
is passenger-segments – if you take a round trip with one connection both ways,
that's 4 “flights”. Most routes need connections, but probably a
disproportionate volume of frequent flights are between hubs and can go direct,
so 1.4 flights in each direction on average seems maybe reasonable? Claude
thinks that's optimistic and says 60–70% of routes will need at least one
connection though, and that's not saying anything about international flights
or flights between remote places that need two or more connections. (I've never
needed more than two, but apparently you can <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/193azxd/what_two_airports_require_the_most_transfers_to/?rdt=53874">find
airport pairs that require up to seven changes</a> if you work at it hard enough!) So
I'll guesstimate a number of 3.2 flights needed per round-trip on average. <1
flight per person per year seems like it might be too low, in which case a
smaller number of people must ever fly? But maybe averages are deceiving, let's
try some more detailed numbers – “ever flown” can mean you fly many times a
year, or you fly once in a decade or once in a lifetime, and there are probably
a lot of people in the lower groups.

.Another interesting constraint is that studies have found
<a href="https://partner.sciencenorway.no/climate-change-global-warming-transport/1-of-people-cause-half-of-global-aviation-emissions-most-people-in-fact-never-fly/1773607">1% of the world's population causes about 50% of global aviation emissions</a>
(the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a> strikes again).

.Here's an attempt to make the numbers work in a spreadsheet:

<img class="center" width="800px" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/flights-frequency-spreadsheet.png">

.Here I suppose that 50% of the people who have ever flown are “very occasional
fliers,” taking a trip by air only a handful of times in their lifetime (about
once a decade). Another 30% fly once every two years on a vacation. Another 15%
live far away from their family or occasionally fly on business, three times
per year on average. And the last 5% (this is actually the 1% quoted above,
divided by the fraction of people we're claiming have ever flown, so it's
elastic and if you change that fraction it will change this and move the
“regular fliers” notch to make 100%) take 10 trips a year on average. (Of
course, some take a lot more, but quite a few people up in this range will take
just a few.)

.That only gets us to 43% of global flights taken by 1% of the population, but
some chunk of these people will often fly first-class or even private, which is
far more carbon-intensive, so I'd bet this ends up being somewhere in the
neighborhood of 50% of <em>emissions</em>. And presumably 50% isn't the exact
number!

.That gets us to around 4.8 billion; 2024 flights are projected to be about 4.9
billion. Interestingly, if we try decreasing the fraction of people in the
world who have ever flown, the number of total flights per year actually has to
go <em>up</em>, because this implies that the fraction of frequent fliers who
are in the top 1% of the whole world's population must increase, which makes me
think 20% is significantly more plausible than 10%; if anything, my estimate of
the number of flights taken by frequent fliers every year seems low, and
raising it would further exacerbate this effect.

.So all this seems maybe about plausible for 20%?
But I made a lot of assumptions, and mostly don't expect them to be super accurate.
Here's the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M1gMtbfJvxBeVg8PQ_4OQVgLc0JLDWyflJRiqrnKFtk/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a>

    :shortdes: You don't have to be cynical about America
    :tags: Society

.The liberal side of American politics has recently shied away from displays of patriotism,
or sometimes even claims that America has any redeeming qualities.
I know people who don't like celebrating Independence Day.
And look – it's reasonable to be disillusioned.
There's a lot to dislike, both in our past and in our present.

.But I think Americans who have become cynical about their country
are spending too much time looking at an absolute scale of how good they can possibly imagine a country being,
instead of a comparison with other actual options.
Yes, this country's history includes, among other things,
racism, slavery, genocide, war crimes, broken promises to entire peoples, hypocrisy, kleptocracy,
pissing contests between leaders that ruin millions of ordinary people's lives, propaganda, and toxic ideologies.
For that matter, many of these are still alive and well today, and all of them are still rooted.
But have you ever tried finding a country that has avoided all, or even most, of those?
Not so easy.

.Certainly, that others also do the wrong thing does not mean you have no responsibility for doing it.
But I think it does illuminate the obvious fact that humans are human and countries are made up of humans,
and so always doing the right thing is impossible.
Giving up on someone because they haven't always done the right thing
is as unreasonable as giving up on them because they haven't learned how to fly yet.
Criticize, sure.
Educate yourself on the failures to inform where you go next, absolutely.
Give up and hate where you live because of events you had no part in? Nah, I'll pass.

.Indeed, accepting imperfection is part of the mythos of America.
We are the land of believing anything can be improved and pursuing ridiculous, impossible dreams –
and always falling short of the dreams.
Yet the better parts of America's history are nothing if not proof that that's a useful exercise;
it still drives change even when you don't make it all the way.
When you inevitably come up short, it's easy to stare ahead at how far short you are and grimace,
but once in a while you ought to also twist your head around and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88XRwBiUGSk">look at how far you've come</a>.
Sometimes it's truly awe-inspiring when you finally do.

.Of course we should keep striving to improve; the status quo is not good enough.
But it's much easier to improve something from a place of love,
    when you aren't trying to find someone to blame,
    when you don't feel guilty about things that aren't your fault,
    when you hope to take something you care deeply for and leave it even better than you found it.
When you start from a place of disillusionment and hate,
    you're more inclined to focus on how bad the world is <a href="https://mosmu.se/#FramePositively">than on how you can make it better</a>,
    improvements seem utterly out of step with the magnitude of the problem,
    and you'll probably give up and leave or spend your time petitioning the Adults In Charge to fix everything.

.Spoiler alert: there are no Adults In Charge. It's up to you.
<a href="https://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com">Allie Brosh</a>:

<img class="center" width="400px" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/somebody-should-do-something.jpg">

.If you dislike America enough that you're looking for a new home,
then I'll let you harbor that dislike.
But if you, like most of us, think your country is your worst option except for all the other ones out there,
I'd like to suggest you might be better off making peace with it.

.As we come closer to political instability and autocracy than we have since the Civil War
and the country faces stagnation and some very serious structural problems,
I think this is more important than ever.
Believe there's something worth preserving and we're on a hero's journey towards something a little bit better every step of the way,
and the snags don't seem so unmanageable.
Maybe it's irrational, but that's OK. It gets results.

    :shortdes: Talking to LLMs is a rare instance where speech-to-text is better
    :tags: AI | Design | Tech

.This is about how fast I type on a typical day:

<img class="center" width="500px" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/typing-speed.png">

.(It was chilly in my office and my fingers were stiff when I did this run; I'd
probably do 5 to 10 words per minute better otherwise.)

.I can certainly still talk faster than I can type, but a natural
conversational pace is probably only about a third faster. Even more
importantly, it's a great deal harder to edit when you're talking, and when I
write I seldom write the entire thing and then go back and edit; I try parts of
each sentence a few times as I work to figure out what I want to say. That
means I find speech-to-text virtually useless for writing – it makes it much
harder to think and doesn't even speed me up much if everything goes perfectly.
And extended writing is the <em>best</em> case for speech-to-text when using a
computer; when the chunks of text you're entering are smaller, the comparative
speed difference is less meaningful and the amount of fiddly editing you can
expect to have to do is even greater.

.When I want to ask Claude or ChatGPT a question, though, the situation is
usually reversed. For one-off interactive use, its performance is no worse if
my input text has typos, corrections, and suboptimal phrasings in it. Typing
out my question feels like quite a lot of work, especially compared to a web
search where I can get away with just a few words. Worse, typing puts me in a
mode of thinking where I try to find the best possible way to phrase what I'm
saying, which is a complete waste of time – in the unlikely event Claude
misunderstands what I meant because I chose my words poorly, I can just clarify
and ask it to try again. And nobody is ever going to see my query after the
conversation is done.

.If you haven't started speaking many of your LLM queries yet, give it a try!

    :shortdes: You can live resize partitions?!
    :tags: Tech

.I keep running out of space on my /home partition on my Linux desktop and
having to carefully move files onto my file server, clear caches, and so on (of
course, the used space usually reaches 100% at the most inconvenient possible
time). I realized at some point that I'd left about 180 GB of unallocated space
at the end of the disk, so I figured I'd extend the /home partition into part
of that space.

.Having grown up in an era when it was impossible to even change the size of a
partition with OS tools, and you'd have to delete it and recreate it (backing
up and restoring your data in the process), I'd been putting this off for
months, thinking I'd have to remind myself how to boot into the rescue
environment to resize the partition, and that sounded pretty annoying.

.But I was absolutely astounded to discover today that nowadays (at least on
disks with a GPT partition table on a recent Linux) you can <em>resize a
partition that's currently mounted and in use</em>, while the OS is running,
without even interrupting disk access requests. I was able to just open
<code>gparted</code>, turn off swap since a swap partition was in the way,
delete the swap partition, extend the /home partition, and recreate the swap
partition (this time at the far end of the disk so I wouldn't even have to do
that again). It took about 90 seconds.

.Nobody's ever going to win much recognition for improving partition table
management, but this goes well with Adam Mastroianni's recent essay “<a
href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/underrated-ways-to-change-the-world">Underrated
ways to change the world</a>” – this silly little innovation will save people
hundreds of thousands of hours of annoying tasks over the course of the coming
decades.

.Sometimes people ask me why it's better to have links and metadata in your
notes than to “just search” for what you're looking for. I came on a great
example tonight: I wanted to review some thoughts I had written down on a
conference session I attended this summer, but I couldn't remember the name of
the session, the person who had presented it, when it happened, or anything
about what I had written in the notes beyond that I was pretty sure the word
“sacred” was in there somewhere.

.This was still easy! I did know the title of the notes for the festival this
had happened at, so I searched for that. Right in that tiddler, I'd made a list
of the couple of people who had stood out to me, and the presenter was one of
them, I immediately recognized her name. I clicked into her tiddler, then the
Sources tab showing all the articles, books, lectures, etc., associated with
that person, and there was the session.

.I finally came into the 2020s last week by ordering the new iPhone 16 Pro to
replace my iPhone XS (the last straw was when I was on the phone with a friend
and my voice kept cutting in and out so that they could barely hear me because
the Lightning port with my headphone adapter plugged in had a really lousy
intermittent connection...if I can't even, you know, reliably <em>make phone
calls</em> on my phone, it's probably time for a new one).

.I went camping over the weekend and spent a while playing with the new cameras
– complete with a physical shutter button: when was the last time Apple added a
button to anything? It still can't beat a nice dedicated camera at everything,
but they're doing little short of magic with three tiny little lenses...and as
always, the best camera is the one you have with you. It's also really cool to
be able to switch from a 13mm wide-angle lens to a 105mm telephoto (and
everything in between) by sliding your finger; that opens up possibilities that
would be annoying or impractical with a normal camera.

.Much of the park at Beaver Creek Valley is, as the name suggests, in a deep
valley, and at this time of year there's some great lighting to play with in the
mid-morning and mid-afternoon, when the sun is still well above the natural
horizon but partially blocked by the hills.

I recently realized that almost all of the difficulty lies in actually getting
the soap refill out and starting the task of refilling the soap dispenser. So
why not just go refill <em>all</em> the soap dispensers in your home at that
point? Sure, it takes a tiny bit longer in the end, since you're refilling

    :shortdes: Bandwidth inflation
    :tags: Tech

.Capitalizing on people's confusion about what a megabit is, folks have
recently started suggesting that you need very large amounts of bandwidth to do
normal things like “stream videos.” E.g., here's an AirBNB listing:

<img class="center" width="400px" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/bandwidth.png" alt="At 564 Mbps, you can take video calls and stream videos.">

.But the truth is that virtually any internet connection available in an urban
area is sufficient for most households. In Minneapolis I have had to get plans
that had much <em>more</em> bandwidth than I would conceivably need, because
there was no option to buy less for cheaper. And while public wifi speeds vary
noticeably, we are in an age of bandwidth abundance. Issues with the wifi being
<em>actually too slow to use</em> have virtually evaporated; I've worked from a
variety of places all over the country in the last 3 years, and I have yet to
encounter wifi that was too slow for anything I was trying to do. (With the
exception of vehicle wifi. Train or bus wifi is in most cases literally the
same kind of mobile hotspot your phone has, but with its bandwidth split over
everyone in the car. Just get mobile hotspot if you need to work on trains.)

.Streaming 8K-quality video
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/796237/what-internet-speed-do-i-need-for-streaming-services/">actually</a>
consumes somewhere around 50&nbsp;Mbps. On the 500&nbsp;Mbps connection this
AirBNB listing is advertising, in theory 10&nbsp;people could be successfully
streaming different movies at cutting-edge resolutions to wall-sized TVs at the
same time! And keep in mind that 8K video is still quite rare, and 4K, at more
like 20&nbsp;Mbps, is perfectly fine for almost every situation. On many
smaller devices you'll get a perfect sharp image at 1080p, which requires only
5 Mbps (and I have yet to see a YouTube video even available at a higher
resolution).

.As recently as a couple of years ago, I had a 12&nbsp;Mbps connection – almost
<em>50&nbsp;times slower</em> than the one advertised here – and I was able to
browse the web, take video calls, and stream movies just fine. That connection
was actually slower than I wanted, and it would have been too slow to reliably
stream 4K video to a large TV, but I didn't have such a TV at the time, and it
was perfectly serviceable.

.The only real benefit of a faster internet connection for most people is that
you don't have to wait as long to download software updates and large files.
But I don't think having my Windows updates download in 30 seconds instead of 3
minutes is worth spending any meaningful amount of money on. Buy accordingly.

.One caveat: many internet providers reliably give you worse speeds than they
advertise. This is especially true of cable-based services, where it's
virtually impossible for them to guarantee a particular speed because the
bandwidth is shared among all customers along the trunk line, so you'll get
much less than advertised at peak times (i.e., exactly the moment your
household will be using lots of bandwidth and you'll most want good speeds). So
it may be wise to halve the advertised number or so when deciding if it's
enough.

    :tags: Personal | Learning | Life

.I had a pile of books and other items that I've wanted to create flashcards
from. As part of a project of cleaning up my life, I decided to just declare
them all finished.

.Yeah, it would be nicer to have actually created flashcards from them. Now I
won't have any until and unless I read them again or go back to look something
up. But…<em>that was the de facto result anyway</em>. Now at least the same
thing won't happen to the <em>next</em> books I read, because I won't be
overwhelmed with the backlogged ones.

.I think people should give up on their backlogs much more often.

    :shortdes: wtfis this command?
    :tags: Tech

.For the Unixers out there: I often find myself encountering some program on my
system (in my package manager or just as a file lying around) and have no idea
what it is. I then spend the next 30 seconds typing a bunch of different
commands trying to figure out what it is in various ways. In the event I can't
figure it out without looking in my package manager's metadata, I tend to even
have to go look up the appropriate command to find the details, or google it!

.I was removing a bunch of software that I don't use anymore that's accumulated
on my main desktop machine over the last couple of years, and found myself
doing this so frequently I got really sick of it. I thus wrote the following
shell function called <code>wtfis</code> that runs all of the things I
typically try in sequence, here presented in the expectation it'll be useful to
someone else some day:

<pre><code>wtfis() {
    pkgnamed_binary=$(which "$1" 2>/dev/null)
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        pkgnamed_binary=""
        echo "wtfis: No '$1' binary on \$PATH"
        echo "wtfis: Instead finding all installed binaries"
        for exfile in $(yay -Qql "$1"); do
            if [ ! -d "$exfile" ] && [ -x "$exfile" ]; then
                echo "$exfile"
            fi
        done
    else
        echo "Binary named for package found in \$PATH: $pkgnamed_binary"
    fi

    echo -e "\n\$ yay -Q --info $1"
    yay -Q --info "$1"

    echo "\$ man $1 | head"
    man "$1" | head

    if [ -n "$pkgnamed_binary" ]; then
        echo -e "\n\$ $1 --help | head"
        "$1" --help | head
    fi
}
</code></pre>

Example (note the $'s are printed by the function to echo the commands it's
running, they're not additional user commands):

    :shortdes: The fraudulent scheme of exchanging money for goods
    :tags: Nonsense | Society | Story

.I burned myself pretty badly on Friday night carelessly taking some hot oil
out of the microwave and was given a prescription for topical antibiotics to
keep the burns from getting infected. At my local CVS, at which I had filled a
prescription successfully once before, I was told CVS didn't take my insurance.

.Obvious response: OK, I won't try to fill a prescription here again, but in
this case I need a simple antibiotic that costs $15 for the dose at hand, and
it's not worth driving to a different pharmacy to have the $15 count against my
$5,000 yearly deductible, so can I just pay cash for it please?

.No, according to the woman behind the desk: if they ran the transaction as
cash pay, that would be <em>insurance fraud</em>.

.Now I may not be a fraud expert, but I did work in insurance for four years,
and, uh, all forms of insurance fraud I'm aware of involve making a claim
against an insurance policy of some kind, which would be what we are
conspicuously <em>not</em> doing. Fortunately I didn't have to argue, because
another pharmacist came up and suggested several ways they could try to handle
the transaction, and after a few minutes we sorted it out and I paid my $15 for
my tube of antibiotic cream and went home. Still, it definitely says something
about the American healthcare system that anybody could reasonably think that
me giving the pharmacy cash in exchange for medicine could be fraud!

    :tags: Nonsense | Story

.In 1956, as a publicity stunt,
Robert Timm and John Cook
flew a Cessna 172 nonstop for <strong>64 days and 22 hours</strong>.
They refueled and received supplies
by flying slowly over a special pickup truck moving at a steady clip in a field
and dropping a hose.

.The plane had been specially modified so the engine could be oiled in-flight,
since it would otherwise seize up after that much continuous operation.
Nevertheless, by the end, the plane was barely operational –
the failures included the autopilot (ouch, on this trip),
the automatic fuel pump,
the landing lights,
the fuel gauge,
and the heater.

.Their record has not been broken almost 70 years later, and no wonder;
who would want to succeed?
After spending 64 days in a four-seater airplane
they couldn't even fully stand up in,
Timm and Cook had to be carried out of the plane when they landed.
Cook:

<blockquote>
    Next time I feel in the mood to fly endurance,
    I’m going to lock myself in a garbage can with the vacuum cleaner running,
    and have Bob serve me T-bone steaks chopped up in a Thermos bottle.
    That is, until my psychiatrist opens for business in the morning.

Lazy consensus is a powerful arrangement for decision-making in small groups.
In a lazy-consensus system, anyone can
    take action,
    make a decision,
    or bring forward a suggestion
    (we'll call this decision, action, suggestion, etc.,
     a <em>proposal</em>).
Every proposal is accepted by default.
If you don't like someone else's proposal, you must step up and object;
    once there's an objection,
    all parties are committed to discussion until a consensus is reached.
Why is this usually a better arrangement for smaller groups
    than the more structured ones
    (e.g., voting)
    that people often extrapolate down from large-scale groups?

    :shortdes: The weirdest travel day I've had in a long time
    :tags: Story | Travel

.I was in North Carolina at the <a
href="https://wildgoosefestival.org/about/">Wild Goose Festival</a> last
weekend. I'll post some more about that once I get my notes sorted out, but in
the meantime, here's what happened on the way back. Nothing scary or
uncomfortable – just hilarious because so many minor things went wrong.

.We left midday Sunday for the airport. Shortly before the airport, we stopped
at a Bojangles for lunch (none of us had ever been to one). Here's how that
went: I walk in, almost completely empty store, just one customer and two
employees. I look over the menu while the cashier stares at his phone, then
order an egg and sausage biscuit. “Oh, we're out of eggs,” he says. Unusual for
a restaurant to be out of eggs, but I get it, it happens, I'll have a ham one,
and fries and a drink. He rings me up, I pay, he gives me a cup. I get to the
soda fountain: there is absolutely zero carbonation, my root beer is sweet
water. I point this out to the guy. “Oh yeah, there's no soda, only punch and
tea.” Would have been nice to know that before I bought a soda, but OK. I get
Hawaiian punch from the fountain, and it's like half strength, if that. As I'm
making a face about that, the guy calls over from the counter: “There's no ham
in the house.” I pause for a second and ask, not trying to hide my irritation,
“What <em>do</em> you have?” He doesn't react or apologize, just deadpan lists
a few things. OK, let's do the chicken. Order arrives: I have a chicken
sandwich instead of the chicken biscuit I ordered. Oh well, it's a darn good
chicken sandwich at least.

.Certainly not a great impression of the chain, though I assume it was this
location and this time!

.Bojangles was only about a three-minute drive from the rental-car line at the
airport. The security line was really long, but we were there a little more
than two hours ahead of our flight, so no big deal, and we boarded uneventfully
too.

.First minor delay because it took longer than usual for the baggage folks to
load the hold given the 97-degree heat on the tarmac. Then the plane was stuck
at the gate for half an hour because the jet bridge wouldn't retract. By the
time they managed to get it retracted, the tug had gone somewhere else and
there was nobody to help us push back. Some tugs came by, but they didn't have
headsets the folks in the cockpit could use to communicate with them, so they
had to send a message to Delta dispatch, who had to call the airport
commission, who had to try to find someone to send. The captain was getting as
annoyed as we were at this point, and the plane was getting pretty hot sitting
on the ground in 97-degree weather without gate power. Finally we got a push,
set out, sat in a fairly long line of planes, and took off.

.At the other end the captain was optimistically like yeah, I think we'll have
you there within ten minutes of the scheduled time! But when we landed there
was (not surprisingly) no gate C9 for us anymore, and we had to wait for quite
a while to be assigned a new one and get over there. Then we had to let the
folks with short connections get off first since we were 30 minutes behind,
which was extremely disorderly. Then, just as I was standing up, an
announcement: there's no power on the jet bridge, please have a flashlight
ready, as it is quite dark! I commented wryly to the captain as I got off,
“Well, there was nothing wrong with the <em>plane</em>, just everything
else...”

.This was not the end of the comedy of delays! We had a little trouble finding
our car, but only a normal amount, and none of us had checked a bag, so we
walked right out. We arrived back at H's place (where we'd carpooled from) and
I was just about to drive off when G came running over – am I in a hurry? Well
kind of, what's up? Her car won't start, the battery died over the weekend. So
I get out my jumper pack and put it on for a few minutes, and the light still
won't even turn on. The battery must be defective or something, or just really
dead? Dunno, but I have real jumper cables we can try a direct start from. But
the car is in the garage and there's no space to pull my car up. Fine, we can
push it a little ways down the driveway. But her transmission won't shift to
neutral. A call to G's brother and a YouTube video later, we manage to figure
out there's a little trim panel you have to pop off and then push a screwdriver
into to release the gearshift when the car has no power. Finally manage to get
it into neutral, G steers while H and I push back a little bit (not hard once
we get it moving because we're going downhill; I had to prompt G to brake a
couple times so it wouldn't run away from us). Stopped car in driveway, pulled
my car up, successful jump – except that there was a huge spark when I made the
final connection. H congratulated me on actually connecting it properly to the
chassis instead of the battery terminal and told me she can't count how many
men she's argued with as they do it wrong. I'm sure she would have called me
out if I had disconnected in the wrong order or something, too!

.I finally left...and promptly got on the freeway in a place where you can't
interchange to the one I need, and had to drive a mile out of my way and pull
up Google Maps to figure out how to get back on the correct one.

.Remarkably, I was home only about an hour and a half later than I originally
expected.

<div class="callout">
My favorite jet bridge story, though, is from choir tour. The plane arrived
early, the baggage handlers hadn't come out yet, and all the baggage had been
loaded at the front of the plane. (I think this was partly because our group
filled more than half the plane and we were only gone for a weekend, so there
was probably less baggage than usual.) As passengers started disembarking, an
announcement: “There's a weight and balance problem. The plane is tipping
forward. Please go back to your seats.” Apparently with all the weight on the
front half of the plane, the plane tilted forward far enough that you couldn't
step from the door to the jet bridge anymore!

    :shortdes: Can flying be more environmentally friendly than driving?
    :tags: Math | Science | Travel

.<em>Short answer</em>: Usually, no. But if you're traveling alone, your car is
moderately inefficient, and the flight is non-stop and fairly efficient,
possibly. This set of circumstances is quite specific but also not uncommon.

<hr>

.My heuristic has always been that flying is by far the environmentally worst
option whenever there are multiple. After all, you're going very fast and you
have to use energy to keep the plane in the air, including all of the enormous
amount of fuel that you haven't burned yet. Most of the figures I've seen have
agreed. I don't particularly like flying anyway, so all things considered, I'll
typically take the train or drive unless I'm going thousands of miles.

.I was faced with this question yesterday: I'm going from Minneapolis to Kansas
City for a weekend. There is no train (for the non-Americans, yes, it's a
400-mile straight-line route between two 2M+-person metro areas, and there is
literally no train there, at any speed, on any schedule). Nobody else is coming
with me. The options I would realistically choose are flying or driving the 7+
hours alone in my Subaru Forester. What makes the most sense?

.I don't love the idea of driving that far in one day without anyone to share
the work with (I solo road-trip all the time, but I plan my trips so I don't
exceed 4 hours or so per day), so I wondered how much worse it would be to fly.
To my surprise, I found that, to my best guess, it was almost within the margin
of error, both on cost and environmental impact!

.I calculated the drive downtown to downtown for simplicity. There will be some
further in-town maneuvering on both ends, and the details might differ slightly
(e.g., if I fly I'll do some of it by public transit that I would otherwise
drive, but also I'll have to get from the airport to the city), but presumably
that will be rounding error compared to the 800-mile intercity trip.

<ul>
    <li>

    <strong>Driving</strong>: 872 miles round trip. I expect my Forester to get
    about 30 mpg; it's rated a little higher on the freeway, but I'd probably
    cruise at 73–75 mph most of the way on such a long, flat route, and I-35
    often has nasty winds that reduce fuel economy. I'll need about 29 gallons
    of gas, maybe a little more. Burning gasoline emits roughly 9 kg
    CO<sub>2</sub>e per gallon, so that's a total emissions of 258 kg.

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Flying</strong>: Google Flights has this nifty emissions calculator that lets you
        compare estimated emissions of different flights. It takes things like the
        type of plane and the expected load factor into account.

        .<img width="800px" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/carbon-gflights.png" alt="81 kg CO2e">

        .Unfortunately, the otherwise pretty decent model <a
        href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-62664981">controversially
        eliminated</a> all non-carbon greenhouse effects a couple of years ago,
        which means it wildly underestimates the impact of most flights.
        Airplanes flying at high altitude create contrails and other forms of
        clouding which cause a temporary but dramatic warming effect – enough
        that this effect can in some cases be responsible for more warming than
        the actual carbon emissions.

        .Fortunately, we can get an estimate of what the actual impact would be
        by multiplying the figure Google Flights gives us by some estimate of
        how large this effect is compared to carbon emissions. The IPCC uses a
        factor of 1.9; some people believe it should be higher in many cases,
        but a relatively short flight like this also spends a lower proportion
        of its time at high altitudes and thus has a lower impact, so this
        seems like a reasonable number.

        .If I pick one of the most carbon-friendly flights in both directions,
        that comes to \( 81 \times 1.9 = 153.9\; \text{kg CO}_\text{2}\text{e}
        \) in each direction, or 308 total. That's roughly a 20% premium for
        flying. So flying isn't <em>better</em> in my case, but it's a whole
        lot closer than I would have expected. If I were driving a less
        efficient car, flying might well come out ahead. (Of course, my car is
        average; if I owned a Fiat or a Chevy Volt, driving would look a good
        deal better.)

    </li>
</ul>

.We need to be careful though: we've only considered the impact of the fuel. A
rule of thumb is that the gas you burn is responsible for only about half of
the total environmental impact of an ICE car, when you consider the materials
that went into building the car, the fluids and parts that get changed out
during maintenance, the infrastructure required to drive your car, the
emissions produced by getting the gas to your fuel tank, and so on. However,
while I haven't seen any specific numbers for airplanes, it intuitively seems
unlikely to be vastly different. Compared to planning your own road trip,
airlines are huge organizations that have a substantial carbon footprint, but
flying also requires a whole lot less infrastructure than driving does; there
are only a few thousand airports worldwide that host regularly scheduled
commercial flights, and in between the plane needs only empty air, while cars
need millions of miles of roads, parking, gas stations, etc. Similarly,
airplanes are much more expensive and complex than cars, but there are way
fewer of them and they carry way more passengers.

.That felt like hand-waving, but then I checked my copy of <em>How Bad Are
Bananas?</em>, in which Mike Berners-Lee does a bunch of lifecycle analyses for
the carbon impact of everyday things. He found a total figure of about 500 kg
for a flight of a touch less than this length, which is very close to what I'd
expect if the non-fuel components are indeed roughly the same as the fuel ones,
so I actually feel fairly confident now. (I wish he would have given some of
the components that went into this number here – he does for some calculations,
but not all of them.)

.It's worth pointing out that this whole thing maths out only because I would
be driving alone. If you have even two people, driving immediately becomes much
better than flying, even if you drive a less efficient car, because the car
loses only a tiny amount of fuel economy by having a second seat filled, while
the amount of the plane's total fuel burn apportioned to you doubles when you
buy two seats. If you fill a four- or five-person car, driving probably even
works out better than taking the train. Similarly, if you have to make a
connection, the overhead of landing and taking off again (plus the additional
distance created by taking an indirect route) is very likely enough to make
flying clearly worse.

.One more consideration: one of the worst impacts of flying is not that it
burns more carbon than alternatives, but that its speed enables additional
travel that wouldn't otherwise have happened at all. If you had to take an
ocean liner from New York to London, which is a 5–7 day trip one-way, it's
unlikely you'd book a five-day vacation there. So before you say “flying's not
so bad!” it's worth considering whether you would have made the trip at all had
you not been able to fly. Here I would have – I didn't even consider flying
until I had already decided to go – but this definitely isn't the case in all
situations.

<div class="callout">

.This wasn't part of the question, but I would feel remiss not to mention that
driving alone is two orders of magnitude more dangerous per mile than taking
the train or flying. For all the apparent scariness of flying, only <a
href="#post-177">1 in 17 million</a> passenger-trips on a commercial airline
ends without safely returning to the ground. To put that into perspective, if
you took ten average-length flights every single day on airlines with an
average safety record, it would take you 4,654 years to reach a cumulative 50%
chance of dying in an airplane accident. It's more dangerous to be at home than
sitting in an airliner, and driving to and from the airport is the most
dangerous part of all but the longest trips by air. (And US airlines are even
safer! An incident on a US passenger flight hasn't killed more than 10 people
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_accidents_and_incidents_involving_commercial_aircraft_in_the_United_States">since
2009</a>, and US airlines take somewhere around <a
href="https://www.bts.gov/newsroom/full-year-2022-us-airline-traffic-data">75
million passenger-trips per <em>month</em></a>, not counting the COVID
dropoff.)

.In contrast, driving is dangerous enough that it might change the best mode
choice in some cases. In the analysis of traveling 400 miles that I quoted
above, Berners-Lee estimates that, when considering what mode is fastest, you
should add <em>2–3 hours</em> of travel time to the driving option to account
for the chance that you lose the rest of your life in a fatal accident. (If you
want to be pedantic and apply this in the other column, too, add 1–2 minutes to
your flight time.) That doesn't even include the chance that you get injured or
kill someone else.

    :tags: Personal | Tech | Writing

.For some time, I've been dissatisfied with the name <em>Zettelkasten</em> for
my primary note-keeping and writing system. While I don't think it's
particularly inaccurate to call the notes “a Zettelkasten,” “Zettelkasten” is a
poor proper name. It doesn't distinguish my system from anyone else's; it's
difficult to spell and pronounce for anyone who doesn't know German; its
literal translation (“slip-of-paper box”) is dull and unevocative, likely
subconsciously worsening the <a
href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#ToolsForThinkingDontWow"> tools
for thinking don't wow</a> problem; and, most importantly, it's a woefully
incomplete description of the mission of the tool, which has shifted and grown
a great deal since I started it in 2020. I started out intending it to be a
place to take notes on things I read, perhaps with some personal-encyclopedia
sort of entries added. It's steadily growing into something that almost feels
like a physical place when I sit in front of it, encompassing all the
information I need to understand both my life and that crazy world out there.
And I hope that it continues to produce novel ways of thinking and relating to
my life. Having a name that was created by another person for another purpose
is a cognitive obstacle to this mission.

.I was flipping through my copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oldest-Twin-Cities-Historic-Treasures/dp/1681064340">Oldest Twin Cities</a>
the other day looking for somewhere to visit on the weekend, and stumbled
across the story of the John J. Stevens House, which was one of the first
private homes in Minneapolis but also the seat of government for the city's
first years.

.In May 1896, it was rotting and the site was slated for redevelopment, but the
house had so much history nobody wanted to see it demolished. Solution? The
newspaper asked children to skip class and come pull the house six miles across
the city to Minnehaha Falls Park, where they served everyone popcorn and
lemonade. Over 10,000 turned out, organized into relay teams, and got the job
done (with assistance from a few horses).

.I'm sure you can pose a million objections to this approach. That seems
dangerous! Child labor! We can't encourage kids to skip school! But all I can
say is, if I ever have children, I want them to live in a world where one of
their childhood memories is cutting class and participating in a city-wide
event to preserve an old, rotting house, not one where the most interesting
thing they ever do is watch some videos on TikTok. How many people die
regretting that they skipped a few days of school or sprained an ankle? Not to
mention that I'm sure every kid in this event learned a lot more about life
from it than from one day of sitting in a classroom. We take ourselves
<em>way</em> too seriously nowadays, and stories of creative accomplishments
are becoming extinct.

    :shortdes: The time a taxi driver called the cops on me
    :tags: Travel | Story

.I didn't include this in <a href="#post-179">my list of St. Paul–Chicago train
stories</a> because it didn't happen on the train and Amtrak wasn't involved at
all, but there was the time I got the cops called on me at two in the morning
over a dispute about the taxi fare, after arriving on that train.

.I was visiting family and the train was so late that nobody could come pick me
up at the commuter rail station when I arrived, so I had someone book me a
taxi. At the station, I got into the taxi and then another woman came up and
asked if she could save some money by sharing the taxi with me, because she was
going somewhere only a few blocks away from where I was headed. I agreed, the
driver agreed, she got in, and we drove the twenty minutes or so down the
highway and arrived at her stop – and the driver asked her for the full fare
showing on the meter.

.The driver told us that it was their policy that, specifically when taking
passengers from a train station, they charged the full fare to each passenger,
unless they were related. Given that we'd told the driver what we intended
ahead of time and he hadn't mentioned this “policy,” we were pretty sure we
were getting scammed and refused. When he threatened to call the police, I thus
told him to go ahead, figuring he wouldn't actually want the police there if he
was trying to scam us. But apparently he wasn't, and this was the actual policy
of the company, so that's how I ended up outside of the cab with the police
telling us if we didn't pay they would arrest us for theft of services.

.I doubt they would have actually arrested anyone over a $20 cab fare, but at
two o'clock in the morning I didn't have much patience, so I just paid figuring
I could dispute the charge with my credit card later. Calling this theft of
services seems ridiculous, too – I wasn't saying I wasn't going to pay the cab
fare, we just disagreed on what the correct amount was. If the driver said the
fare was $20,000, would they arrest me if I didn't pay up? I think they were
just bored.

.Also, the driver was texting and driving on the way. He nearly ran off the
road multiple times during the trip, and did not apologize or apparently think
this was concerning.

.I have not ridden with Krazy Kab since, and would consider walking before
giving them any more of my business. (Perhaps the name should have been a tipoff.)

    :shortdes: Borealis train service between Chicago and Minneapolis–St. Paul starts Tuesday
    :tags: Minneapolis | Travel

.As someone who has taken 43 one-way train trips between southeast Minnesota
and Chicago in the last 10 years (yes, I counted), I am very excited to report
that Amtrak is adding a
<a href="https://media.amtrak.com/2024/05/introducing-amtrak-borealis-trains-with-expanded-service-between-st-paul-and-chicago-via-milwaukee/">second daily train</a>
between them! The existing service
is fine, but it's nice not to be hamstrung into always leaving Minneapolis at
8:50am and Chicago at 3:05pm. Arriving home at 11:45pm once you disembark,
walk to the parking lot, and drive home is a bit of a downer when you have work
the next day, in particular.

.Both directions will leave at midday, with the St. Paul departure at about
11:30 and the Chicago one about 11:00 (<em>edit</em>: corrected Chicago time).

.As a bonus, the eastbound Borealis ought to be on time much more often. The
current service is provided by the Empire Builder long-distance route, which
comes all the way from Seattle, so the timetable often can't recover from
delays up in the Rockies and elsewhere out West. The on-time performance has
been tolerable in the last few years (it used to be absolutely dreadful, with
3-hour delays being average and 8-hour ones not altogether unusual), but
sometimes you really want to be confident you can arrive at a specific time.

.One of my favorite singer-songwriters is doing a concert in Milwaukee
Wednesday after next, and I had some Amtrak points burning a hole in my virtual
wallet, so I'm taking a free trip down there to try it out. We'll see how it
goes!

<div class="callout">
Best story from those 43 trips? I'll let you decide:

<ul>
    <li>
        I had dinner with a self-described “Marxist nihilistic anarchist” who
        believed that vacuum-tube amps allowed you to communicate with the dead.
        (Transistorized ones apparently aren't up to the task.)
    </li>
    <li>
        I sat in a nearly empty car with three blonde mid-twenties hairdressers,
        perfectly matching every stereotype you can think of, on their way to
        a cosmetology conference in Chicago. They got on in Milwaukee already
        with some alcohol behind them, and by the time we got into the Chicago
        suburbs they had gotten kicked out of the observation car for being too
        loud and disruptive. I wasn't thrilled to have them back with me,
        though it was at least entertaining.
    </li>
    <li>
        A guy in a bad mood said to the snack bar attendant, “I need a hot
        tea.” She refused to give him a tea until he said he “would like a hot
        tea, please.”
    </li>
    <li>
        I asked someone I had a really nice dinner conversation with in the
        dining car on a date (we both lived in the Twin Cities). She said
        no, but that this can happen is quite reflective of the social
        atmosphere on the train I think.
    </li>
    <li>
        The train was so late that they cracked out instant rice and canned
        beef stew from some secret cabinet and gave everyone a free meal.
        Should you ever be unlucky enough to be on a train this late, it is
        actually surprisingly good beef stew. (It might be a point of
        Amtrak-rider pride to have ridden enough to encounter the fabled
        late-train beef stew, I'm not sure.)
    </li>
    <li>
        I talked with a woman sitting next to me, named Casandra, for almost
        the entire trip (probably about 6 hours), about how her life was
        falling apart, and about everything else that led to – possibly the
        best conversation I've ever had with a stranger. We had enough
        chemistry by the end that a girl across the aisle asked us if we were
        dating. I still think about her sometimes and hope she's doing well; I
        wish I'd gotten her number.
    </li>
    <li>
        We went over a section of tracks that were on fire. The conductor came by and
        explained that they sometimes intentionally light kerosene fires over switches
        when it gets really cold in order to prevent them from seizing up.
    </li>
</ul>

.Oh, and not my story, but when I was talking about this train with someone I
know, she claimed she once made out with the sleeping-car attendant in her
compartment.

    :shortdes: Trying to learn about your friends is already genuine
    :tags: Learning | Society

.I maintain a series of documents about many people I know in my <a
href="https://remnote.com/">RemNote</a> knowledge base containing flashcards
about things like the names of their family members, some of their best
stories, unusual preferences they have, and so on. These cards are both useful
and enjoyable to practice.

.Some people avoid doing this because they're afraid it is fake or weird.
Michael Nielsen <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">
describes</a> this concern:

<blockquote>
    It seems too much like faking interest in my friends. There's a pretty
    strong social norm that if you remember your friends' taste in music or
    their kids' names, it's because you're interested in that friend. Using a
    memory aid feels somehow ungenuine, at least to me.
</blockquote>

.I think this worry involves an unexamined misapprehension of the flow of
causality involved in this practice. It's indeed true that it's expected that
if you remember your friend's taste in music, that's because you're interested
in them. But that you're using flashcards to remember it doesn't exclude that
possibility at all. The implied claim that connects this to ungenuineness seems
to be that if you're using a memory aid (viz., spaced-repetition flashcards),
you're using it as a substitute for actually caring about them: <em>knowing
facts &rarr; appearance of caring</em>. Certainly, one could do this (e.g., as
a confidence artist or slimy salesperson). Instead, for me, and I would presume
for most people who actually do this in practice, caring about the person is
upstream of creating flashcards about them: <em>actual caring &rarr; knowing
facts &rarr; appearance of caring</em>. I'm trying to learn more about the
person because I already care about them.

.Why would I spend the time creating and reviewing flashcards about someone I
didn't actually care about? These aren't people I'm trying to sell things to or
hook up with, we're talking about people I want to build long-term personal
relationships with for no other reason than that I like them. Sure, it's not
like studying the flashcards takes a huge amount of time, but it's not a
trivial time investment either!

.It does seem to me that most people on the receiving end understand this as well.
Nielsen notes later:

<blockquote>
    Most [friends I've talked to about this] have told me the same thing: they
    appreciate me going to so much trouble in the first place.

    when she opened up the envelope, she found that, while the layout was beautiful

    ragged edges on both margins all the way down the page. Irritated, she called
    the printer and asked how they thought they could skip doing half the job.

    :shortdes: Ringing off the hook
    :tags: Language

.In thinking about <a href="#post-171">#171</a>, I was reminded there is also
the idiom “to ring off the hook,” meaning to get so many calls the phone is
ringing constantly. (Confusingly, if your phone is ringing off the hook, you
might have to take it off the hook so you can relax!) But I couldn't explain
exactly what this kind of ringing had to do with being off the hook – after
all, the intended result of the phone ringing is that it ends up off the hook
because somebody answers it, right? Why is that any different when you get a
lot of calls compared to just one?

.It seems nobody else knows for sure either, but I found at least two
plausible theories:

<ul>
    <li>The phone is ringing so much that the vibration literally causes the
    handset to work itself loose and fall off the hook.</li>

    <li>Because so many people are calling, the phone feels like it's ringing
    again before you even replace it on the hook, even though this is not
    actually happening (perhaps it starts ringing after you replace the handset
    but before you've let go of it).</li>
</ul>

    :shortdes: Being off-hook is no more
    :tags: Language | Music | Society | Tech

.I was playing a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3DNNrjayQw">cover</a>
of Billy Joel's song “Vienna” for a friend the other day, and we
came to this line:

<blockquote>
    Slow down, you crazy child,<br>
    Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while.
</blockquote>

.I remarked that if you didn't grow up with landlines, this line now makes
absolutely no sense, only a few decades later. We still say “pick up” and “hang
up,” which often don't correspond to anything you're physically doing with the
phone anymore, but at least there the metaphor is transparent; even if you've
never “hung up” a phone, you can imagine how that would work and figure out
what it meant.

.“Take the phone off the hook” is a different kind of datedness. First of all,
in its physical interpretation, it would seem to mean the opposite of what it
actually means: surely you would take the phone off the hook if you were
<em>getting ready to make a call</em>. You need a lot more context to figure
out what the phrase means, and I don't think the song is enough. You can
understand from the lyrics that it somehow means you're going to be taking time
for yourself, but I don't think you'd be able to explain why if you'd never
used a landline.

<div class="callout">
<img width="250px" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em;" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/hook.png" alt="A picture of a phone taken off the hook.">
<p>
    For those reading this who in fact fall into this category (now I feel
    old): when you're not using a landline, the handset rests on a little
    spring-loaded tongue called the “hook”. When you pick up the phone to dial a number or
    answer, the hook pops up and opens the line so you can listen and
    talk. While the hook is raised, your phone won't ring and anyone calling
    you will hear the busy signal, because normally when the hook is raised,
    you're talking to someone already.
</p>
<p>
    Consequently, if you, intentionally or unintentionally, leave the phone off
    the hook when you're not actually making a call, the phone will never ring.
    Because it's a dumb mechanical switch, this is true even if, say, the last
    person you were talking to hung up an hour ago and you got distracted and
    left the phone sitting on the coffee table.
</p>
</div>

.Beyond that, though, the original phrase is basically untranslatable into
modern terms. Imagine: “Put your phone on Do Not Disturb mode and disappear for
a while”? It's much harder to make software menu choices sound poetic than
physical objects. Even more importantly, there's a way in which taking the
phone off the hook felt a little subversive, because it wasn't something you
were supposed to do. Both by design (the phone exchange would scream at you
with that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_gmt_Sry7g">obnoxious
tone</a> through the earpiece) and by social convention (in the late 20th
century, if a phone was ringing, someone was expected to answer it, and
intentionally making the phone impossible to answer doesn't really meet that
obligation!). Now that we have a purpose-designed do-not-disturb mode, you
can't really evoke this feeling anymore – turning it on, or just deciding not
to answer the phone, is completely normal.

.Interestingly, that comes at the same time as our boundaries around
disconnecting have <a
href="https://controlaltbackspace.org/convenience/">gotten even worse</a> than
they were at the time this song was written. I'm not sure what to make of that.
Maybe it's that our enemy in staying calm and relaxed used to be other people
bothering us, and now it's <em>us</em> searching for novelty.

    :shortdes: Please go see a total solar eclipse sometime in your life
    :tags: Life | Science | Travel

.I made a crazy trip to go see the total solar eclipse in the US last week. I
intended to watch from the lower Midwest / South, but after I'd settled in at
Little Rock and started killing time for a couple days (having come from seeing
family at Easter nearby), the cloud forecast looked so bad that I hopped on a
flight to Albany and drove to cloudless skies in Quebec instead, not wanting to
take the chance of having to wait another 20 years for the next one in the US.
(Why Quebec? It was the only place in the Northeast in the good-weather zone
where I could still find a hotel room at the point that I re-booked. Good thing
I happened to bring my passport on a trip to Arkansas.)

.But I digress. Guys, you have to go see one of these if you ever have a
chance. It was totally worth even this action-packed itinerary. I don't think
it's an exaggeration to say it was both the most beautiful and the most
awe-inspiring thing I've ever seen. People don't seem to talk about this much
for some reason, but about half of people cry; personally, I was laughing
uncontrollably and crying at the same time.

.(And just to be clear: people often mistakenly think a partial solar eclipse
is very similar to a total solar eclipse and they've already basically seen
one. Even a 99% partial solar eclipse is nothing at all like a total one; it's
an entirely different <a
href="https://www.space.com/solar-eclipse-april-2024-strange-phenomena">set of
phenomena</a>. Annie Dillard famously <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170827062123/https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/annie-dillards-total-eclipse/536148/">wrote</a>
that it's like the difference between kissing a man and marrying him: one
precedes the other, but in no way prepares you for it. A partial solar eclipse
is worth going outside and looking up at the sky to see, but ultimately a

    :shortdes: Powdered dishwasher detergent is the only reasonable kind
    :tags: Design | Life

.For some reason, people persist in making and buying other kinds, and I don't
get it.

.The little packs are supposedly more convenient, because you don't have to
measure them. But how hard is it to measure dishwasher detergent? Step one,
open the cap and pour into the reservoir until the reservoir is full. Step
two...there is no step two, you're done. Do you drink individually bottled
water at home because it's too hard to measure the water when you fill up a
glass? It's the same thing! Meanwhile, if the packs get even slightly damp or
your hands are wet when you pull the packs out, they get messy; they sometimes
don't dissolve and spread out properly; if you have a non-standard dishwasher
size, you get the wrong amount of detergent; and if your dishwasher has a
pre-rinse function and you can't fit the pack inside the flip-shut door, the
detergent gets used up before the proper cycle starts. Also, they're more
expensive. All that because it's too hard to pick up the box of dishwasher
detergent, open the spout, and pour detergent into the dishwasher?

.Meanwhile, gel makes even less sense. If you spill powdered detergent, you can
just sweep it up; if you spill gel, it's incredibly messy. Gel is also heavier,
less compact, and more expensive because you're paying to transport water,
which, in case you didn't notice, is going to fill the dishwasher in just a
moment anyway. And you don't even get to skip thinking about how much to pour.

    :shortdes: In which Amazon.com incorrectly calculates unit prices
    :tags: Math | Nonsense | Tech

.I was buying some Kleenex on Amazon and was about to select a pack of 8
because that was about how many I needed, when I looked at the quoted unit
price and was slightly surprised, because the unit price was less than half
that of the 3-pack:

<img width="300px" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/wrong-kleenex-prices.png" alt="A 3-pack, 120 count: $4.16 per 100 sheets. An 8-pack, 120 count: $1.70 / 100 sheets.">

.A quick multiplication by 3 in my head in an attempt to resolve the dissonance
set off alarm bells. The unit price on the left is more than double the unit
price on the right, but when you multiply it out, if you buy 3 of the 3-packs
you get 9 boxes of tissues for a couple cents less than $15, which is less than
the price for 8 boxes shown on the right!

.Closer inspection yields the unavoidable conclusion that the first unit price
is just plain wrong:

<ul>
    <li>For the 8-pack, there are \( 120 \times 8 = 960 \) sheets, and \( \$16.33 / 960 \times 100 = \$1.70 \) per 100 sheets (as listed).</li>
    <li>For the 3-pack, there are \( 120 \times 3 = 360 \) sheets, and \( \$4.99 / 360 \times 100 = \$1.38 \) per 100 sheets (not even close to $4.16!).</li>
</ul>

.It appears that somehow the “pack of 3” part didn't get included in the first
calculation, but did in the second (if there were 120 sheets total in the pack
of 3 it would be correct).

.This is the listing for Kleenex on Amazon – hardly an unpopular product – so
it's kind of shocking this could be left wrong for any significant amount of
time. I reported an issue, so we'll see if they fix it:

<img loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/wrong-kleenex-prices-amazon.png" alt="Correspondence to Amazon complaining.">

    :shortdes: What problem is the thing you're explaining trying to solve?
    :tags: Design | Education

.Yesterday I ran across David MacIver's “<a
href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/10/how-to-explain-anything-to-anyone/">How
to Explain Anything to Anyone</a>,” which makes the interesting point that it's
often more helpful to explain new ideas beginning with the problem they're
solving, rather than the solution.

.This helped me come up with a much better elevator speech for <a
href="https://remnote.com">RemNote</a>; I've always been dissatisfied with my
explanation, and I get a lot of time to be dissatisfied with it because people
ask me what I do for work all the time! I tell people that it combines notes
and flashcards, uses learning science to help you remember more efficiently,
etc., but I can't help but think it sounds incredibly boring and not really
novel in any way.

.We're solving two important cascading problems at RemNote, so we can explain it
better like this:

<blockquote>

.One reason learning and being creative is hard is because we constantly forget
earlier things we've learned and have to relearn them. There's already a highly
effective way to solve this problem called <em>spaced repetition</em>, which
presents flashcards to you at optimal moments and lets you remember anything
for your whole life with only a couple minutes' effort.

.However, right now making flashcards that work well is too hard. RemNote aims
to address this problem and make better learning accessible to everyone:

<ul>

    <li>We allow you to efficiently write flashcards right within your notes,
    so you can create them as you're reading a book or listening to a lecture
    without any extra steps.</li>

    <li>We use AI to help you automatically create flashcards, then understand
    why flashcards you're struggling with are hard and fix them.</li>

    <li>We'll eventually provide well-designed flashcards – maybe with
    associated learning materials – off the shelf for common topics or courses
    of study.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>

.About a year ago, in <a href="#post-70">#70</a>, I noted that I'd been stumped
on explaining what TiddlyWiki was to someone I had just met – and I had just
written a book on TiddlyWiki! I think part of the issue here is that TiddlyWiki
doesn't solve a unified problem; it's a general enabling environment that
solves different problems for different people. For me, I think it solves some
problem like this:

<blockquote>

.A key way I think is <a
href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#WritingIsThinking">by
writing</a>. But traditional ways of organizing writing-as-thinking, like
journals, have a major problem in that you lose track of everything you've
written on a previous topic; writing helps you get material out of your brain,
but in some sense your record is write-only. TiddlyWiki offers a highly
customizable wiki-like work environment, so I can link my thoughts together in
a way that prevents them from getting lost, and make the workspace and
organization work exactly the same way as my brain.

</blockquote>

.This still feels underwhelming, though. It may be that the <a
href="https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/#ToolsForThinkingDontWow">tools
for thinking don't wow</a> problem is stronger with TiddlyWiki. And we have
lost a great deal of generality. Oh well, it was a nice try.

    :shortdes: I've changed my mind about listing your pronouns
    :tags: Design | Society

.In other words, in the signature of an email to someone I don't know, I might
write, e.g., “Soren Bjornstad (he/him)”, and I think this is a good idea.

.To be clear, this is not, like, something I decided yesterday, it's been my
opinion for a while, but today I realized that I didn't currently have mine on
my <a href="https://sorenbjornstad.com/">landing page</a> and added them, and I
noted that a couple of years ago I definitely wouldn't have seen that as worth
doing, so here I am saying this.

.I used to suppose that the only reason to list your pronouns as a cis person
was that it was <em>nice</em>, because it made people who needed to list them
to not get misgendered all the time stand out less. Then I reasoned it was
just too much to ask (at least among general audiences) for everyone to take up
a bunch of extra space when introducing themselves to slightly improve the
lives of a small minority of people.

.Is that true? Maybe, maybe not? It's going to depend on your values, and
probably on who you know. (I'm happy to admit that I care a lot more now than I
used to because I've gotten to know a lot more people for whom this is a big
issue – the phenomenon of caring more about problems you're closer to is just
part of human nature I'm afraid.) But I kind of don't care, because there's a
much better argument: this is actually a classic <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design">universal design</a>
situation, where a change benefits everyone, not just the minority. Online and
in writing, pretty frequently, even if someone has a completely normative
gender presentation in real life, you still can't tell their gender or
pronouns! You're relying on having a name that's gendered, and all of your
readers being familiar enough with the name to know that. (<em>Soren</em> is
never a female name as far as I'm aware, but it's unusual enough where I am
that once in a while I get someone who thinks I'm a woman.) And in writing,
your eyes will just skip right over the pronouns if they're what you expected,
once you have some basic familiarity with the idea.

    :shortdes: Do lots of mid-to-high-income households really have no savings?
    :tags: Finance | Society | Statistics

.There's a common narrative that you can be living paycheck-to-paycheck at any
income level, and that this is shockingly common – some ridiculous percentage
of people with $100,000 household incomes still can't pay for a modest
unexpected expense out of savings!

.But when I went to look up <a
href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/emergency-savings-report/">this
statistic</a> recently, something gave me pause. The Bankrate article linked
shows this chart:

<img width="600px" loading="lazy" class="center" src="assets/images/1000-savings.png" alt="Shoulder bag. Contents of images are described below each.">

.It struck me that, though I have perfectly adequate emergency savings, if
presented with this survey, I might well choose “reduce your spending on other
things,” which means Bankrate would count me as part of the (implicitly
financially unprepared) “majority of U.S. adults [who] wouldn't pay for an
emergency expense...from their savings account,” and which often gets rounded
in discussions surrounding this issue to “people who <em>couldn't</em> pay for
an unexpected $1,000 expense from their savings.” But while borrowing money to
pay for an unexpected expense is a last resort that you want to avoid, reducing
your spending on other things is an even better response than paying from your
savings, if you can do it without major discomfort. After all, if you want to
bring your emergency savings back to whatever comfortable level you had set it
at before, you're going to have to divert some money into there eventually
anyway; why not just do it right away, if you can?

.I usually handle unexpected expenses by charging them to my credit card and
moving some money from other categories in my <a
href="https://ynab.com">YNAB</a> budget to cover it. If I have to, I might take
some of that money from a savings category, even the “emergency savings” one,
but I'll be aggressively filling it back in starting with my next paycheck. If
I stop channeling new savings into whatever I'm currently saving for and point
it to refilling the loss here instead, chances are I'll cover it by the time
the credit card bill actually hits my bank account, which will take upwards of
a month from the expense. (Getting ~45 days to pay by using a credit card is a
free service as long as you pay your bill in full every month!) So in some
sense, even if I took money out of the “emergency savings” category – which I
might not do at all; maybe I'd just delay another major purchase for a month or
two – I only “used my emergency savings” on paper.

.This got me curious, and I dug into the rest of their data. They say that 70%
of households with a yearly income of at least $100,000 or more would pay with
savings, which does seem fairly bad for that level of income, but then lower
down they find that 75% of such households had enough savings to cover
<em>three months of household expenses</em>. I'm quite sure that three months
of household expenses for a $100,000-per-year household is sufficient to cover
a $1,000 expense! Clearly these households just wouldn't want or need to pay
the expense from their savings, perhaps for reasons like mine. Unfortunately,
the exact details of the survey don't appear to be publicly available, so we
don't know much about what they say they'd do instead.

.It is true that this still means 25% of $100K+ households don't have three months of
expenses saved, and the survey finds that 5% of them have <em>no</em> emergency
savings, which is bad, sure. I'm not saying that I now believe it's impossible
to be paycheck-to-paycheck on a high income; obviously it is. But a
single-to-low-double-digit number of $100K+ households being financially
irresponsible doesn't really seem shocking.

<div class="callout"> <em>Minor Gripe:</em> In the survey question, they count
“car repair” as an unexpected expense. If you own a car, I can all but
guarantee it's going to need $1,000 of repairs at some point (if not, can I buy
your car?), so this hardly seems unexpected. Car owners should be saving
separately to fix their car; when you need repairs, you pay out of your “car
repair” money and barely even notice. </div>

to try to see the <a

time, as they tend to become difficult to find if you wait to buy them.
However, I couldn't figure out where to put them in the meantime so I don't
have to tear the house apart looking for them come April; I don't own anything
else much like them, and I don't have a specific place for items I want to take
on future trips.

.My solution: Put them in the box with my clothes iron in my bedroom (purely
because it was distinctive and there was plenty of space), then create a
flashcard asking where I put my eclipse glasses. Even in the event that I don't
remember the actual answer, I'll for sure remember that I made a flashcard
about it and can go search my knowledge base for it.

    :shortdes: The expectation that things won't last
    :tags: Society

.I was at Home Depot today picking up a few things, and an employee came up to
me in the trim aisle trying to pitch their spring sale, 25% off all HVAC
equipment and installation. He asked me if I needed anything replaced in this
area. I told him no, and he persisted, “Well, how old is your heating and air
conditioning?”

.I told him my co-op's steam boiler was 102 years old. He mumbled something
about how old equipment lasts, then <em>still</em> insisted on clarifying that
I'm not solely responsible for deciding to replace it before he wandered off.

.But that got me thinking: that boiler is original to the building (which is
how I know its age to the year). It was originally coal-fired; at some point it
was retrofitted to run on natural gas, and it's still working great today,
needing only occasional regular maintenance (one of my neighbors learned and
became a licensed boiler technician to take care of it on the cheap). All the
radiators are original, too. One of mine kind of needs a new coat of paint,
that's about it.

.Of course, nowadays you're lucky if your new furnace lasts 15 years, maybe 10,
so this seems remarkable. But isn't it actually more remarkable that we think
it's reasonable that an expensive climate-control unit only lasts for ten
years? This is <em>wild</em>. The original heating systems in early 1900s
buildings usually outlived the building, and that shouldn't even be that hard,
because most buildings get torn down or changed beyond recognition long before
they reach the end of their usable life. We've just decided that it's normal to
buy things that suck and can't be maintained and repaired.

.Do we have better heating nowadays? I'm not even sure about that! Steam heat
is way more pleasant to live with than forced-air heat or electric baseboard
heat, though roughly equivalent to hydronic systems. Most steam systems do lack
per-unit thermostats, but surprisingly this doesn't prove to be much of an
issue; when I first moved into a building without them, I thought it was going
to be terrible, but after the first few weeks, I just shrug on the occasional
days when my apartment is slightly too hot or too cold (we're talking like 5°F
maximum), go “It's a little cold today!” and put on a sweater. Some natural
variation is good for you; it's almost like pleasant changes in indoor weather.

.And sure, newer boilers and furnaces are more efficient, but you know what's
inefficient? Buying an entire new furnace every ten years. I'm sure we could
save money on the gas bill if we ripped out the entire steam-heating system and
replaced it with a modern hydronic system, but that would be insanely expensive
and I guarantee you that one wouldn't last another 102 years. If, on optimistic
assumptions, we managed to redo the nineteen-unit-plus-basement building with a
whole new HVAC system for $100,000, and this cut our winter energy bill in half
for a savings of about $2,500 per year, I still don't think we'd ever make it
back – even before discounting, it would take 40 years to break even, and good
luck getting a modern commercial HVAC to last 40 years. Far better to invest
the difference and have it ready when the old one at long last becomes
unrepairable – and who knows when that will be? Maybe it'll last so long the
point will be moot by then (e.g., maybe the building burns down or we sell it
and it's no longer our problem).

.Anyway, I want to choose more things that last for my apartment, so please
tell me off if I try to get vinyl flooring or whatever badly-aging material or
appliance is fashionable.

<div class="callout">
<em>Tangent</em>:
The folks who installed the heat here also made the brilliant design decision not
to put a radiator in the bedroom. Because you can't just go turn the heat up
and down when it's the wrong temperature, the people who laid out heating
systems used to have to think very carefully about things like the wind
direction, where the sun would shine during the winter, the number of windows
in the room, how heat would spill from and to adjacent apartments, and the
ideal air temperature for each activity, so the temperature would end up right.
So here the bedroom is automatically about five degrees cooler, matching most
people's preference for a slightly cooler sleeping area, and you can adjust it
anywhere from about three to seven degrees depending on the weather and your
personal preferences by deciding how far open to leave the door when you go to
bed. Only the most expensive heating systems today have an effective way to set
a different temperature in one room than another, and here with 1920s
technology it happens automatically!

everyone knows the feeling, and as the name suggests, it's somewhat the
opposite of ennui. Rather than a vague feeling of tiredness and boredom (or

    :shortdes: Problems I can't believe nobody has solved, part one
    :tags: Tech | Travel

.Here's a problem that one would think the internet would straightforwardly
solve, but apparently doesn't. Suppose I feel like taking a short leisure trip
in a couple of weeks. Where should I go? Maybe I have some ideas about when and
where, but I'm flexible, and I don't particularly care how I get there (plane,
train, bus, maybe driving; some itineraries would be a deal-breaker, of course,
like 24 hours on a bus with 3 transfers, but many options would be reasonable).
I want to find something that's cheap and convenient. Maybe it could also watch
fares for places I'm interested in and let me know when it finds something
particularly cheap (there are some sites that do this with flights specifically
on a somewhat limited basis, so this is clearly possible).

.Of course, some people claim to have a solution, but every attempt I've seen
utterly fails at one or more obvious requirements, e.g.:

<ul>
    <li>It includes <em>only</em> plane tickets, or <em>only</em> bus and/or train tickets.</li>
    <li>It doesn't allow for any flexibility; you already have to know exactly where and when you want to go.</li>
    <li>It can't find any cross-mode or cross-company transfers, and/or doesn't consider that you could stay overnight somewhere (which you might enjoy seeing anyway).</li>
    <li>It just plain doesn't find connections that I know exist, and aren't exactly secrets
        (e.g., I found a site that claimed it didn't know of any way to get from Chicago to Indianapolis).</li>
</ul>

.Even Google Flights, with a somewhat restricted problem to work on, sometimes
does a bad job at this; the pricing calendar lists the absolute cheapest fare
it finds, which sounds like what you want until you realize that, instead of
giving you the price for an obvious direct flight, it gave you the price for a
24-hour flight on Spirit that goes clear across to the other side of the
country and has a 15-hour layover, and all the even slightly sensible flights
are twice that and might not be the cheapest on the same day.

.Maybe this is a much harder problem than I realize, but it seems like plenty
of individual companies' booking sites do a good job at most of this, and
solving the full problem seems like merely that plus aggregation (which isn't
trivial by any means, but other places do it fine on its own), so I'm not sure
I believe it.

.If you don't have a smartwatch – and maybe even if you do but you don't always

able to tell what source a notification came from without having to look. If
you're getting a calendar notification and you didn't remember you had anything

want to stop and see if you need to change plans.

information and you only have to learn it once. I also find it's much easier to
make mnemonic tones this way; more on that in a moment! (For this to work, you
need to have “Haptics” set to <em>Always Play</em> in <em>Settings &gt; Sounds
& Haptics</em>, so that even if your phone is off silent mode you'll get the
vibration.)

.The remaining piece of the puzzle is learning the patterns for all the people
you frequently text and want to be able to distinguish. I've found using Morse
code makes this vastly easier: you might already know a little bit of it, and
it was designed to be easily distinguishable in a noisy environment. Usually I
use the first one or two letters of the person's name (add a second letter if
the first one is so short in Morse code that it might cause you to miss the
notification entirely, or if it conflicts with some other existing tone). I
record these as new custom haptic patterns as I need them and name them with
whatever they spell in Morse code (e.g., “C”). As a bonus, you learn a little
bit of Morse code!

.I assume there's a way to do this on Android as well, but I've never tried, so
I don't know where the options are.

    :tags: Personal

I've compiled a list of eight broad ideas I'm fascinated by and trying to
explore this year – some intellectual, some experiential, some creative
(although really, the path to understanding any idea involves all three). The
ideas are as follows, expanded upon in much more detail in the linked
Zettelkasten tiddler:

<ul>
    <li>Understanding the goodness of places</li>
    <li>Becoming committed to the best places</li>
    <li>Living and working in community</li>
    <li>Experiencing romantic relationships</li>
    <li>Searching for deep friendships</li>
    <li>Turning inversion of control into a life strategy</li>
    <li>Making education worth the time</li>
    <li>Building and understanding mission through written reflection</li>
</ul>

    :shortdes: Counterintuitive density
    :tags: Statistics

.Quick, what's the densest metro area in the US? I'll give you a hint: It's
almost certainly not what you think.

.The most natural answer would probably be New York, but I bet you didn't pick
that because that would be the obvious answer. Maybe San Francisco? Or Miami?

    <summary>Answer and discussion</summary>

.Believe it or not,
<a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural/2020-ua-facts.html">the answer is Los Angeles</a> at 7,476 people per square mile,
well ahead of San Francisco at 6,843 and New York at 5,981.
(San Jose is a separate metro area in the statistics and squeezes in between them.
 Honolulu, of all places, is fifth –
 makes sense once you think about it, but definitely comes as a surprise.)
That's mighty odd because LA is known for its sprawl.
The trick is that we're measuring populations within full metro areas,
not city limits
(LA would certainly not win if we did city limits!).
While the most built-up areas of New York and San Francisco
are much larger and denser than those of LA,
LA has medium-high density throughout almost the entire metro area,
while NY and SF are composed of dense but relatively small cores
surrounded by comparatively low-density areas.

.Averages are confusing sometimes!
