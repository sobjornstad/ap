      "text": "Heinlein's \"juvenile\" SF novel _Time for the Stars_ is very much centered around telepathy between twins. The story takes a rather, uh, surprising turn by the end - also driven by telepathy...and Heinlein's proclivities.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_for_the_Stars\n\nThe indy comic book series _Elfquest_ features telepathy (\"sending\") between specific elven characters and their animal companions. The series may seem dated, but I re-read it pretty recently I think the story has held up extremely well.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfquest\n\nThe Pinis have also made Elfquest free to read online:\nhttps://elfquest.com/read/digitalEQ.html"

Don't want to spoiler anything, but there is an extensive wiki, if you are interested in the concepts primarily and don't want to read 800k words. IMO it's worth it though.\n\nhttps://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning"
